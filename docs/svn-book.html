    composed not of the questions people actually ask, but of the
    questions the FAQ's author <span class="emphasis"><em>wishes</em></span> people
    would ask.  Perhaps you've seen the type before:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Q: How can I use Glorbosoft XYZ to maximize team
      productivity?</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A: Many of our customers want to know how they can
      maximize productivity through our patented office groupware
      innovations.  The answer is simple.  First, click on the
      <code class="literal">File</code> menu, scroll down to
      <code class="literal">IncreaseÂ Productivity</code>,
      thenâ¦</p></blockquote></div><p>The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a
    literal sense, FAQs at all.  No one ever called the tech support
    line and asked, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">How can we maximize
    productivity?</span>â</span>  Rather, people asked highly specific
    questions, such as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">How can we change the calendaring system
    to send reminders two days in advance instead of one?</span>â</span>
    and so on.  But it's a lot easier to make up imaginary
    Frequently Asked Questions than it is to discover the real ones.
    Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, organized
    effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions
    must be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a
    coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective
    experience of users in the wild.  It calls for the patient,
    observant attitude of a field naturalist.  No grand
    hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements hereâopen eyes
    and accurate note-taking are what's needed most.</p><p>What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such
    a process, and shows it on every page.  It is the direct result
    of the authors' encounters with users.  It began with Ben
    Collins-Sussman's observation that people were asking the same
    basic questions over and over on the Subversion mailing lists:
    what are the standard workflows to use with Subversion?  Do
    branches and tags work the same way as in other version control
    systems?  How can I find out who made a particular change?</p><p>Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben
    worked intensely over a month in the summer of 2002 to write
    <em class="citetitle">The Subversion Handbook</em>, a 60-page
    manual that covered all the basics of using Subversion.  The
    manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was
    distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump
    in the learning curve.  When O'Reilly decided to
    publish a full-length Subversion book, the path of least
    resistance was obvious: just expand the Subversion
    handbook.</p><p>The three coauthors of the new book were thus presented
    with an unusual opportunity.  Officially, their task was to
    write a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an
    initial draft.  But they also had access to a steady
    streamâindeed, an uncontrollable geyserâof bottom-up
    source material.  Subversion was already in the hands of
    thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of
    feedback, not only about Subversion, but also about its existing
    documentation.</p><p>During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and
    Brian haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms
    incessantly, carefully noting the problems users were having in
    real-life situations.  Monitoring such feedback was part of their
    job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge
    advantage when they set out to document Subversion.  The book
    they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience,
    not in the shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the
    best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet.  This duality might
    not be noticeable on a first reading.  Taken in order, front to
    back, the book is simply a straightforward description of a
    piece of software.  There's the overview, the obligatory guided
    tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced
    topics, and of course, a command reference and troubleshooting
    guide.  Only when you come back to it later, seeking the
    solution to some specific problem, does its authenticity shine
    out: the telling details that can only result from encounters
    with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine use cases,
    and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the
    user's point of view.</p><p>Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer
    every question you have about Subversion.  Sometimes the
    precision with which it anticipates your questions will seem
    eerily telepathic; yet occasionally, you will stumble into a
    hole in the community's knowledge and come away empty-handed.
    When this happens, the best thing you can do is email
    <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:users@subversion.apache.org">users@subversion.apache.org</a>&gt;</code> and present your
    problem.  The authors are still there and still watching, and the
    authors include not just the three listed on the cover, but many others
    who contributed corrections and original material.  From the
    community's point of view, solving your problem is merely a
    pleasant side effect of a much larger projectânamely,
    slowly adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion itself, to
    more closely match the way people actually use it.  They are
    eager to hear from you, not only because they can help you, but
    because you can help them.  With Subversion, as with all active

    System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control for many
    years.  And rightly so.  CVS was open source software itself, and
    its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked
    operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers
    to share their work.  It fit the collaborative nature of the
    open source world very well.  CVS and its semi-chaotic development
    model have since become cornerstones of open source
    culture.</p><p>But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those
    flaws promised to be an enormous effort.  Enter Subversion.
    Subversion was designed to be a successor to CVS, and its
    originators set out to win the hearts of CVS users in two
    waysâby creating an open source system with a design
    (and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">look and feel</span>â</span>) similar to CVS, and by
    attempting to avoid most of CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the
    result wasn'tâand isn'tâthe next great evolution in
    version control design, Subversion <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> very
    powerful, very usable, and very flexible.</p><p>This book is written to document the 1.7 series of the Apache
    Subversionâ¢<sup>[<a id="idp25361504" href="#ftn.idp25361504" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> version control system.  We have made
    every attempt to be thorough in our coverage.  However, Subversion
    has a thriving and energetic development community, so already a
    number of features and improvements are planned for future
    versions that may change some of the commands and specific notes
    in this book.</p><div class="sect1" title="What Is Subversion?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.intro.whatis"></a>What Is Subversion?</h2></div></div></div><a id="idp31203088" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp31204480" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp31205488" class="indexterm"></a><p>Subversion is a free/open source <em class="firstterm">version control
      system</em> (VCS).  That is, Subversion manages files and
      directories, and the changes made to them, over time.  This
      allows you to recover older versions of your data or examine the
      history of how your data changed.  In this regard, many people
      think of a version control system as a sort of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">time
      machine.</span>â</span></p><p>Subversion can operate across networks, which allows it to
      be used by people on different computers.  At some level, the
      ability for various people to modify and manage the same set of
      data from their respective locations fosters collaboration.
      Progress can occur more quickly without a single conduit through
      which all modifications must occur.  And because the work is
      versioned, you need not fear that quality is the trade-off for
      losing that conduitâif some incorrect change is made to
      the data, just undo that change.</p><a id="idp31209072" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp31210256" class="indexterm"></a><p>Some version control systems are also <em class="firstterm">software
      configuration management</em> (SCM) systems.  These
      systems are specifically tailored to manage trees of source code
      and have many features that are specific to software
      developmentâsuch as natively understanding programming
      languages, or supplying tools for building software.
      Subversion, however, is not one of these systems.  It is a
      general system that can be used to manage
      <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> collection of files.  For you, those
      files might be source codeâfor others, anything from
      grocery shopping lists to digital video mixdowns and
      beyond.</p><div class="sect2" title="Is Subversion the Right Tool?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.intro.righttool"></a>Is Subversion the Right Tool?</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're a user or system administrator pondering the use
        of Subversion, the first question you should ask yourself is:
        "Is this the right tool for the job?"  Subversion is a
        fantastic hammer, but be careful not to view every problem as
        a nail.</p><p>As a first step, you need to decide if version control in
        general is required for your purposes.  If you need to archive
        old versions of files and directories, possibly resurrect
        them, and examine logs of how they've changed over time, then
        version control tools can do that.  If you need to collaborate
        with people on documents (usually over a network) and keep
        track of who made which changes, a version control tool can do
        that, too.  In fact, this is why version control tools such as
        Subversion are so often used in software development
        environmentsâworking on a development team is an
        inherently social activity where changes to source code files
        are constantly being discussed, made, evaluated, and even
        sometimes unmade.  Version control tools facilitate that sort
        of collaboration.</p><p>There is cost associated with using version control, too.
        Unless you can outsource the administration of your version
        control system to a third-party, you'll have the obvious costs
        of performing that administration yourself.  When working with
        the data on a daily basis, you won't be able to copy, move,
        rename, or delete files the way you usually do.  Instead,
        you'll have to do all of those things through the version
        control system.</p><p>Even assuming that you are okay with the cost/benefit
        tradeoff afforded by a version control system, you shouldn't
        choose to use one merely because it <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>
        do what you want.  Consider whether your needs are better
        addressed by other tools.  For example, because Subversion
        replicates data to all the collaborators involved, a common
        misuse is to treat it as a generic distribution system.
        People will sometimes use Subversion to distribute huge
        collections of photos, digital music, or software packages.
        The problem is that this sort of data usually isn't changing
        at all.  The collection itself grows over time, but the
        individual files within the collection aren't being changed.
        In this case, using Subversion is
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">overkill.</span>â</span><sup>[<a id="idp31219296" href="#ftn.idp31219296" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup> There are simpler tools that
        efficiently replicate data <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> the
        overhead of tracking changes, such as <span class="command"><strong>rsync</strong></span>
        or <span class="command"><strong>unison</strong></span>.</p><p>Once you've decided that you need a version control
        solution, you'll find no shortage of available options.  When
        Subversion was first designed and released, the predominant
        methodology of version control was <em class="firstterm">centralized
        version control</em>âa single remote master
        storehouse of versioned data with individual users operating
        locally against shallow copies of that data's version history.
        Subversion quickly emerged after its initial introduction as
        the clear leader in this field of version control, earning
        widespread adoption and supplanting installations of many
        older version control systems.  It continues to hold that
        prominent position today.</p><p>Much has changed since that time, though.  In the years
        since the Subversion project began its life, a newer
        methodology of version control called <em class="firstterm">distributed
        version control</em> has likewise garnered widespread
        attention and adoption.  Tools such as Git
        (<a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_top">http://git-scm.com/</a>) and Mercurial
        (<a class="ulink" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" target="_top">http://mercurial.selenic.com/</a>) quickly rose
        to the tops of the distributed version control system (DVCS)
        ranks.  Distributed version control harnesses the growing
        ubiquity of high-speed network connections and low storage
        costs to offer an approach which differs from the centralized
        model in key ways.  First and most obvious is the fact that
        there is no remote, central storehouse of versioned data.
        Rather, each user keeps and operates against very
        deepâcomplete, in a senseâlocal version history
        data stores.  Collaboration still occurs, but is accomplished
        by trading <em class="firstterm">changesets</em> (collections of
        changes made to versioned items) directly between users' local
        data stores, not via a centralized master data store.  In
        fact, any semblance of a canonical <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">master</span>â</span>
        source of a project's versioned data is by convention only, a
        status attributed by the various collaborators on that
        project.</p><p>There are pros and cons to each version control approach.
        Perhaps the two biggest benefits delivered by the DVCS tools
        are incredible performance for day-to-day operations (because
        the primary data store is locally held) and vastly better
        support for merging between branches (because merge algorithms
        serve as the very core of how DVCSes work at all).  The
        downside is that distributed version control is an inherently
        more complicated model, which can present a non-negligible
        challenge to comfortable collaboration.  Also, DVCS tools do
        what they do well in part because of a certain degree of
        control withheld from the user which centalized systems freely
        offerâthe ability to implement path-based access
        control, the flexibility to update or backdate individual
        versioned data items, etc.  Fortunately, many wise
        organizations have discovered that this needn't be a religious
        debate, and that Subversion and a DVCS tool such as Git can be
        used together harmoniously within the organization, each
        serving the purposes best suited to the tool.</p><p>Alas, this book is about Subversion, so we'll not attempt
        a full comparison of Subversion and other tools.  Readers who
        have the option of choosing their version control system are
        encouraged to research the available options and make the
        determination that works best for themselves and their fellow
        collaborators.  And if, after doing so, Subversion is the
        chosen tool, there's <span class="emphasis"><em>plenty</em></span> of detailed
        information about how to use it successfully in the chapters
        that follow!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Subversion's History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.intro.history"></a>Subversion's History</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp31231824" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp31233216" class="indexterm"></a><p>In early 2000, CollabNet,
        Inc. (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net" target="_top">http://www.collab.net</a>) began seeking
        developers to write a replacement for CVS.  CollabNet
        offered<sup>[<a id="idp31235088" href="#ftn.idp31235088" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> a collaboration software suite
        called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE), of which one
        component was version control.  Although CEE used CVS as its
        initial version control system, CVS's limitations were obvious
        from the beginning, and CollabNet knew it would eventually
        have to find something better.  Unfortunately, CVS had become
        the de facto standard in the open source world largely because
        there <span class="emphasis"><em>wasn't</em></span> anything better, at least
        not under a free license.  So CollabNet determined to write a
        new version control system from scratch, retaining the basic
        ideas of CVS, but without the bugs and misfeatures.</p><p>In February 2000, they contacted Karl Fogel, the author of
        <em class="citetitle">Open Source Development with CVS</em>
        (Coriolis, 1999), and asked if he'd like to work on this new
        project.  Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already
        discussing a design for a new version control system with his
        friend Jim Blandy.  In 1995, the two had started Cyclic
        Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and
        although they later sold the business, they still used CVS
        every day at their jobs.  Their frustration with CVS had led
        Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned
        data, and he'd already come up with not only the Subversion
        name, but also the basic design of the Subversion data store.
        When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the
        project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to
        essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period
        of time.  CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and
        detailed design work began in May 2000.  With the help of some
        well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of
        CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time an independent
        developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process),
        Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers.
        It turned out that many people had encountered the same
        frustrating experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to
        finally do something about it.</p><p>The original design team settled on some simple goals.  They
        didn't want to break new ground in version control methodology,
        they just wanted to fix CVS.  They decided that Subversion would
        match CVS's features and preserve the same development model,
        but not duplicate CVS's most obvious flaws.  And although it did
        not need to be a drop-in replacement for CVS, it should be
        similar enough that any CVS user could make the switch with
        little effort.</p><p>After 14 months of coding, Subversion became
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">self-hosting</span>â</span> on August 31, 2001.  That is,
        Subversion developers stopped using CVS to manage Subversion's
        own source code and started using Subversion instead.</p><p>While CollabNet started the project, and still funds a
        large chunk of the work (it pays the salaries of a few
        full-time Subversion developers), Subversion is run like most
        open source projects, governed by a loose, transparent set of
        rules that encourage meritocracy.  In 2009, CollabNet worked
        with the Subversion developers towards the goal of integrating
        the Subversion project into the Apache Software Foundation
        (ASF), one of the most well-known collectives of open source
        projects in the world.  Subversion's technical roots,
        community priorities, and development practices were a perfect
        fit for the ASF, many of whose members were already active
        Subversion contributors.  In early 2010, Subversion was fully
        adopted into the ASF's family of top-level projects, moved its
        project web presence to
        <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org</a>, and was

        Media in 2004, shortly after Subversion had reached 1.0.
        Since that time, the Subversion project has continued to
        release new major releases of the software.  Here's a quick
        summary of major new changes since Subversion 1.0.  Note that
        this is not a complete list; for full details, please visit
        Subversion's web site at
        <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org</a>.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.1 (September 2004)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.1 introduced FSFS, a flat-file repository
              storage option for the repository.  While the Berkeley DB
              backend is still widely used and supported, FSFS has
              since become the default choice for
              newly created repositories due to its low barrier to
              entry and minimal maintenance requirements.  Also in
              this release came the ability to put symbolic links
              under version control, auto-escaping of URLs, and a
              localized user interface.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.2 (May 2005)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.2 introduced the ability to create
              server-side locks on files, thus serializing commit
              access to certain resources.  While Subversion is still
              a fundamentally concurrent version control system,
              certain types of binary files (e.g. art assets)
              cannot be merged together.  The locking feature fulfills
              the need to version and protect such resources.  With
              locking also came a complete WebDAV auto-versioning
              implementation, allowing Subversion repositories to be
              mounted as network folders.  Finally, Subversion 1.2
              began using a new, faster binary-differencing algorithm
              to compress and retrieve old versions of files.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.3 (December 2005)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.3 brought path-based authorization
              controls to the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server,
              matching a feature formerly found only in the Apache
              server.  The Apache server, however, gained some new
              logging features of its own, and Subversion's API
              bindings to other languages also made great leaps
              forward.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.4 (September 2006)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.4 introduced a whole new
              toolâ<span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>âfor doing
              one-way repository replication over a network.  Major
              parts of the working copy metadata were revamped to no
              longer use XML (resulting in client-side speed gains),
              while the Berkeley DB repository backend gained the
              ability to automatically recover itself after a server
              crash.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.5 (June 2008)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.5 took much longer to finish than prior
              releases, but the headliner feature was gigantic:
              semi-automated tracking of branching and merging.  This
              was a huge boon for users, and pushed Subversion far
              beyond the abilities of CVS and into the ranks of
              commercial competitors such as Perforce and ClearCase.
              Subversion 1.5 also introduced a bevy of other
              user-focused features, such as interactive resolution of
              file conflicts, sparse checkouts, client-side
              management of changelists, powerful new syntax for
              externals definitions, and SASL authentication support for
              the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.6 (March 2009)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.6 continued to make branching and merging
              more robust by introducing tree conflicts, and offered
              improvements to several other existing features: more
              interactive conflict resolution options; de-telescoping
              and outright exclusion support for sparse checkouts;
              file-based externals definitions; and operational
              logging support for <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> similar
              to what <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> offered.  Also,
              the command-line client introduced a new shortcut syntax
              for referring to Subversion repository URLs.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Subversion 1.7 (October 2011)</span></dt><dd><p>Release 1.7 was primarily a delivery vehicle for two
              big plumbing overhauls of existing Subversion
              components.  The largest and most impactful of these was
              the so-called <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">WC-NG</span>â</span>âa complete
              rewrite of the <span class="command"><strong>libsvn_wc</strong></span> working copy
              management library.  The second change was the
              introduction of a sleeker HTTP protocol for Subversion
              client/server interaction.  Subversion 1.7 delivered a
              handful of additional features, many bug fixes, and some
              notable performance improvements, too.</p></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Audience"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.preface.audience"></a>Audience</h2></div></div></div><p>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line-based.  That command-line tool
      (<span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>), and some additional auxiliary
      programs, are the focus of this book.</p><p>For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader
      is using a Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable
      with Unix and command-line interfaces.  That said, the
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program also runs on non-Unix platforms
      such as Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor exceptions, such as
      the use of backward slashes (<code class="literal">\</code>) instead of
      forward slashes (<code class="literal">/</code>) for path separators, the
      input to and output from this tool when run on Windows are
      identical to that of its Unix counterpart.</p><p>Most readers are probably programmers or system
      administrators who need to track changes to source code.  This
      is the most common use for Subversion, and therefore it is the
      scenario underlying all of the book's examples.  But Subversion
      can be used to manage changes to any sort of
      informationâimages, music, databases, documentation, and
      so on.  To Subversion, all data is just data.</p><p>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used a version control system, we've also tried
      to make it easy for users of CVS (and other systems) to make a
      painless leap into Subversion.  Special sidebars may mention
      other version control systems from time to time, and
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.forcvs" title="AppendixÂ B.Â Subversion for CVS Users">AppendixÂ B, <em>Subversion for CVS Users</em></a> summarizes many of the differences
      between CVS and Subversion.</p><p>Note also that the source code examples used throughout the
      book are only examples.  While they will compile with the proper
      compiler incantations, they are intended to illustrate a
      particular scenario and not necessarily to serve as examples of good
      programming style or practices.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="How to Read This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.preface.howread"></a>How to Read This Book</h2></div></div></div><p>Technical books always face a certain dilemma:  whether to
      cater to <em class="firstterm">top-down</em>
      or to <em class="firstterm">bottom-up</em> learners.  A top-down
      learner prefers to read or skim documentation, getting a large
      overview of how the system works; only then does she actually
      start using the software.  A bottom-up learner is a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">learn by
      doing</span>â</span> personâsomeone who just wants to dive into the
      software and figure it out as she goes, referring to book
      sections when necessary.  Most books tend to be written for one
      type of person or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased
      toward top-down learners.  (And if you're actually reading this
      section, you're probably already a top-down learner yourself!)
      However, if you're a bottom-up person, don't despair.  While the
      book may be laid out as a broad survey of Subversion topics, the
      content of each section tends to be heavy with specific
      examples that you can try-by-doing.  For the impatient folks who

    its approach to version control.  We begin with a discussion of
    general version control concepts, work our way into the specific
    ideas behind Subversion, and show some simple examples of
    Subversion in use.</p><p>Even though the examples in this chapter show people sharing
    collections of program source code, keep in mind that Subversion
    can manage any sort of file collectionâit's not limited to
    helping computer programmers.</p><div class="sect1" title="Version Control Basics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.basic.version-control-basics"></a>Version Control Basics</h2></div></div></div><a id="idp32330064" class="indexterm"></a><p>A version control system (or revision control system) is a
      system that tracks incremental versions (or revisions) of files
      and, in some cases, directories over time.  Of course, merely
      tracking the various versions of a user's (or group of users')
      files and directories isn't very interesting in itself.  What
      makes a version control system useful is the fact that it allows
      you to explore the changes which resulted in each of those
      versions and facilitates the arbitrary recall of the
      same.</p><p>In this section, we'll introduce some fairly high-level
      version control system components and concepts.  We'll limit our
      discussion to modern version control systemsâin today's
      interconnected world, there is very little point in
      acknowledging version control systems which cannot
      operate across wide-area networks.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.repository"></a>The Repository</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32376848" class="indexterm"></a><p>At the core of the version control system is a repository,
        which is the central store of that system's data.  The
        repository usually stores information in the form of a
        <em class="firstterm">filesystem tree</em>âa hierarchy of
        files and directories.  Any number of
        <em class="firstterm">clients</em> connect to the repository, and
        then read or write to these files.  By writing data, a client
        makes the information available to others; by reading data,
        the client receives information from others.
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.repository.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 1.1.Â A typical client/server system">FigureÂ 1.1, âA typical client/server systemâ</a> illustrates
        this.</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.basic.repository.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 1.1.Â A typical client/server system</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch02dia1.png" alt="A typical client/server system"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br><p>Why is this interesting?  So far, this sounds like the
        definition of a typical file server.  And indeed, the
        repository <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a kind of file server, but
        it's not your usual breed.  What makes the repository special
        is that as the files in the repository are changed, the
        repository remembers each version of those files.</p><p>When a client reads data from the repository, it normally
        sees only the latest version of the filesystem tree.  But what
        makes a version control client interesting is that it also has
        the ability to request previous states of the filesystem from
        the repository.  A version control client can ask historical
        questions such as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">What did this directory contain last
        Wednesday?</span>â</span> and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Who was the last person to
        change this file, and what changes did he make?</span>â</span>
        These are the sorts of questions that are at the heart of any
        version control system.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Working Copy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.working-copy"></a>The Working Copy</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32386432" class="indexterm"></a><p>A version control system's value comes from the fact that it
        tracks versions of files and directories, but the rest of the
        software universe doesn't operate on <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">versions of files
        and directories</span>â</span>.  Most software programs understand
        how to operate only on a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> version
        of a specific type of file.  So how does a version control
        user interact with an abstractâand, often,
        remoteârepository full of multiple versions of various
        files in a concrete fashion?  How does his or her word
        processing software, presentation software, source code
        editor, web design software, or some other programâall
        of which trade in the currency of simple data filesâget
        access to such files?  The answer is found in the version
        control construct known as a <em class="firstterm">working
        copy</em>.</p><p>A working copy is, quite literally, a local copy of a
        particular version of a user's VCS-managed data upon which
        that user is free to work.  Working copies<sup>[<a id="idp32390576" href="#ftn.idp32390576" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup> appear to other software
        just as any other local directory full of files, so those
        programs don't have to be <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">version-control-aware</span>â</span>
        in order to read from and write to that data.  The task of
        managing the working copy and communicating changes made to
        its contents to and from the repository falls squarely to the
        version control system's client software.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Versioning Models"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.vsn-models"></a>Versioning Models</h3></div></div></div><p>If the primary mission of a version control system is to
        track the various versions of digital information over time, a
        very close secondary mission in any modern version control
        system is to enable collaborative editing and sharing of that
        data.  But different systems use different strategies to
        achieve this.  It's important to understand these different
        strategies, for a couple of reasons.  First, it will help you
        compare and contrast existing version control systems, in case
        you encounter other systems similar to Subversion.  Beyond
        that, it will also help you make more effective use of
        Subversion, since Subversion itself supports a couple of
        different ways of working.</p><div class="sect3" title="The problem of file sharing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.vsn-models.problem-sharing"></a>The problem of file sharing</h4></div></div></div><p>All version control systems have to solve the same
          fundamental problem: how will the system allow users to
          share information, but prevent them from accidentally
          stepping on each other's feet?  It's all too easy for users
          to accidentally overwrite each other's changes in the
          repository.</p><p>Consider the scenario shown in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.vsn-models.problem-sharing.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 1.2.Â The problem to avoid">FigureÂ 1.2, âThe problem to avoidâ</a>.
          Suppose we have two coworkers, Harry and Sally.  They each
          decide to edit the same repository file at the same time.
          If Harry saves his changes to the repository first, it's
          possible that (a few moments later) Sally could accidentally
          overwrite them with her own new version of the file.  While
          Harry's version of the file won't be lost forever (because
          the system remembers every change), any changes Harry made
          <span class="emphasis"><em>won't</em></span> be present in Sally's newer version
          of the file, because she never saw Harry's changes to begin
          with.  Harry's work is still effectively lostâor at
          least missing from the latest version of the fileâand
          probably by accident.  This is definitely a situation we want
          to avoid!</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.basic.vsn-models.problem-sharing.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 1.2.Â The problem to avoid</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch02dia2.png" alt="The problem to avoid"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br></div><div class="sect3" title="The lock-modify-unlock solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.vsn-models.lock-unlock"></a>The lock-modify-unlock solution</h4></div></div></div><a id="idp32337392" class="indexterm"></a><p>Many version control systems use a
          <em class="firstterm">lock-modify-unlock</em> model to address
          the problem of many authors clobbering each other's work.
          In this model, the repository allows only one person to
          change a file at a time.  This exclusivity policy is managed
          using locks.  Harry must <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">lock</span>â</span> a file before
          he can begin making changes to it.  If Harry has locked a
          file, Sally cannot also lock it, and therefore cannot make
          any changes to that file.  All she can do is read the file
          and wait for Harry to finish his changes and release his
          lock.  After Harry unlocks the file, Sally can take her turn
          by locking and editing the file.
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.vsn-models.lock-unlock.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 1.3.Â The lock-modify-unlock solution">FigureÂ 1.3, âThe lock-modify-unlock solutionâ</a>

          a bit restrictive and often becomes a roadblock for
          users:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Locking may cause administrative
              problems.</em></span>

              Sometimes Harry will lock a file and then forget about it.
              Meanwhile, because Sally is still waiting to edit the file,
              her hands are tied.  And then Harry goes on vacation.  Now
              Sally has to get an administrator to release Harry's lock.
              The situation ends up causing a lot of unnecessary delay
              and wasted time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Locking may cause unnecessary
              serialization.</em></span>

              What if Harry is editing the beginning of a text file,
              and Sally simply wants to edit the end of the same file?
              These changes don't overlap at all.  They could easily
              edit the file simultaneously, and no great harm would
              come, assuming the changes were properly merged together.
              There's no need for them to take turns in this
              situation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Locking may create a false sense of
              security.</em></span>

              Suppose Harry locks and edits file A, while Sally
              simultaneously locks and edits file B.  But what if A and
              B depend on one another, and the changes made to each are
              semantically incompatible?  Suddenly A and B don't work
              together anymore.  The locking system was powerless to
              prevent the problemâyet it somehow provided a false
              sense of security.  It's easy for Harry and Sally to
              imagine that by locking files, each is beginning a safe,
              insulated task, and thus they need not bother discussing
              their incompatible changes early on.  Locking often
              becomes a substitute for real communication.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" title="The copy-modify-merge solution"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge"></a>The copy-modify-merge solution</h4></div></div></div><a id="idp32424352" class="indexterm"></a><p>Subversion, CVS, and many other version control systems
          use a <em class="firstterm">copy-modify-merge</em> model as an
          alternative to locking.  In this model, each user's client
          contacts the project repository and creates a personal
          working copy.  Users then work simultaneously and
          independently, modifying their private copies.  Finally, the
          private copies are merged together into a new, final
          version.  The version control system often assists with the
          merging, but ultimately, a human being is responsible for
          making it happen correctly.</p><p>Here's an example.  Say that Harry and Sally each create
          working copies of the same project, copied from the
          repository.  They work concurrently and make changes to the
          same file A within their copies.  Sally saves her changes to
          the repository first.  When Harry attempts to save his changes
          later, the repository informs him that his file A is
          <em class="firstterm">out of date</em>.  In other words, file A
          in the repository has somehow changed since he last copied
          it.  So Harry asks his client
          to <em class="firstterm">merge</em> any new changes from the
          repository into his working copy of file A.  Chances are
          that Sally's changes don't overlap with his own; once he has
          both sets of changes integrated, he saves his working copy
          back to the repository.

          with Harry's changes?  What then?  This situation is called a
          <em class="firstterm">conflict</em>, and it's usually not much
          of a problem.  When Harry asks his client to merge the
          latest repository changes into his working copy, his copy of
          file A is somehow flagged as being in a state of conflict:
          he'll be able to see both sets of conflicting changes and
          manually choose between them.  Note that software can't
          automatically resolve conflicts; only humans are capable of
          understanding and making the necessary intelligent choices.
          Once Harry has manually resolved the overlapping
          changesâperhaps after a discussion with Sallyâhe
          can safely save the merged file back to the
          repository.</p><p>The copy-modify-merge model may sound a bit chaotic, but
          in practice, it runs extremely smoothly.  Users can work in
          parallel, never waiting for one another.  When they work on
          the same files, it turns out that most of their concurrent
          changes don't overlap at all; conflicts are infrequent.  And
          the amount of time it takes to resolve conflicts is usually
          far less than the time lost by a locking system.</p><p>In the end, it all comes down to one critical factor:
          user communication.  When users communicate poorly, both
          syntactic and semantic conflicts increase.  No system can
          force users to communicate perfectly, and no system can
          detect semantic conflicts.  So there's no point in being
          lulled into a false sense of security that a locking system
          will somehow prevent conflicts; in practice, locking seems
          to inhibit productivity more than anything else.</p><div class="sidebar" title="When Locking Is Necessary"><a id="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge.sb-1"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>When Locking Is Necessary</strong></p></div></div></div><p>While the lock-modify-unlock model is considered
            generally harmful to collaboration, sometimes
            locking is appropriate.</p><p>The copy-modify-merge model is based on the assumption
            that files are contextually mergeableâthat is, that the
            majority of the files in the repository are line-based text
            files (such as program source code).  But for files with
            binary formats, such as artwork or sound, it's often
            impossible to merge conflicting changes.  In these
            situations, it really is necessary for users to take strict
            turns when changing the file.  Without serialized access,
            somebody ends up wasting time on changes that are ultimately
            discarded.</p><p>While Subversion is primarily a copy-modify-merge
            system, it still recognizes the need to lock an occasional
            file, and thus provides mechanisms for this.  We discuss
            this feature in <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.locking" title="Locking">the section called âLockingâ</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Version Control the Subversion Way"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.basic.in-action"></a>Version Control the Subversion Way</h2></div></div></div><p>We've mentioned already that Subversion is a modern,
      network-aware version control system.  As we described in
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.version-control-basics" title="Version Control Basics">the section called âVersion Control Basicsâ</a> (our
      high-level version control overview), a repository serves as the
      core storage mechanism for Subversion's versioned data, and it's
      via working copies that users and their software programs
      interact with that data.  In this section, we'll begin to
      introduce the specific ways in which Subversion implements
      version control.</p><div class="sect2" title="Subversion Repositories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.svn-repositories"></a>Subversion Repositories</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion implements the concept of a version control
        repository much as any other modern version control system
        would.  Unlike a working copy, a Subversion repository is an
        abstract entity, able to be operated upon almost exclusively
        by Subversion's own libraries and tools.  As most of a user's
        Subversion interactions involve the use of the Subversion
        client and occur in the context of a working copy, we spend
        the majority of this book discussing the Subversion working
        copy and how to manipulate it.  For the finer details of the
        repository, though, check out
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin" title="ChapterÂ 5.Â Repository Administration">ChapterÂ 5, <em>Repository Administration</em></a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Revisions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.revs"></a>Revisions</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32450992" class="indexterm"></a><p>A Subversion client commits (that is, communicates the
        changes made to) any number of files and directories as a
        single atomic transaction.  By atomic transaction, we mean
        simply this: either all of the changes are accepted into the
        repository, or none of them is.  Subversion tries to retain
        this atomicity in the face of program crashes, system crashes,
        network problems, and other users' actions.</p><p>Each time the repository accepts a commit, this creates a
        new state of the filesystem tree, called a
        <em class="firstterm">revision</em>.  Each revision is assigned a
        unique natural number, one greater than the number assigned to
        the previous revision.  The initial revision of a freshly
        created repository is numbered 0 and consists of nothing but
        an empty root directory.</p><p><a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 1.6.Â Tree changes over time">FigureÂ 1.6, âTree changes over timeâ</a>
        illustrates a nice way to visualize the repository.  Imagine
        an array of revision numbers, starting at 0, stretching from
        left to right.  Each revision number has a filesystem tree
        hanging below it, and each tree is a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">snapshot</span>â</span>
        of the way the repository looked after a commit.</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 1.6.Â Tree changes over time</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch02dia7.png" alt="Tree changes over time"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br><div class="sidebar" title="Global Revision Numbers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Global Revision Numbers</strong></p></div></div></div><a id="idp32458208" class="indexterm"></a><p>Unlike most version control systems, Subversion's
          revision numbers apply to <span class="emphasis"><em>the entire repository
          tree</em></span>, not individual files.  Each revision number
          selects an entire tree, a particular state of the repository
          after some committed change.  Another way to think about it
          is that revision N represents the state of the repository
          filesystem after the Nth commit.  When Subversion users talk
          about <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revision 5 of
          <code class="filename">foo.c</code>,</span>â</span> they really mean
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in revision
          5.</span>â</span> Notice that in general, revisions N and M of a
          file do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> necessarily differ!  Many
          other version control systems use per-file revision numbers,
          so this concept may seem unusual at first. (Former CVS users

        files and directories in Subversion repositories.  For the
        most part, these URLs use the standard syntax, allowing for
        server names and port numbers to be specified as part of the
        URL.</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact><li class="listitem">http://svn.example.com/svn/project</li><li class="listitem">http://svn.example.com:9834/repos</li></ul></div></div><p>Subversion repository URLs aren't limited to only
        the <code class="literal">http://</code> variety.  Because Subversion
        offers several different ways for its clients to communicate

        differ subtly depending on which repository access mechanism
        is employed.  <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.wc.tbl-1" title="TableÂ 1.1.Â Repository access URLs">TableÂ 1.1, âRepository access URLsâ</a>

        For example, URLs containing the <code class="literal">file://</code>
        access method (used for local repositories) must, in
        accordance with convention, have either a server name
        of <code class="literal">localhost</code> or no server name at
        all:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact><li class="listitem">file:///var/svn/repos</li><li class="listitem">file://localhost/var/svn/repos</li></ul></div></div><p>Also, users of the <code class="literal">file://</code> scheme on
        Windows platforms will need to use an unofficially
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">standard</span>â</span> syntax for accessing repositories
        that are on the same machine, but on a different drive than
        the client's current working drive.  Either of the two
        following URL path syntaxes will work, where
        <code class="literal">X</code> is the drive on which the repository
        resides:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact><li class="listitem">file:///X:/var/svn/repos</li><li class="listitem">file:///X|/var/svn/repos</li></ul></div></div><p>Note that a URL uses forward slashes even though the
        native (non-URL) form of a path on Windows uses backslashes.
        Also note that when using
        the <code class="literal">file:///<em class="replaceable"><code>X</code></em>|/</code>
        form at the command line, you need to quote the URL (wrap it
        in quotation marks) so that the vertical bar character is not
        interpreted as a pipe.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>You cannot use Subversion's <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs
          in a regular web browser the way typical
          <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs can.  When you attempt to view
          a <code class="literal">file://</code> URL in a regular web browser, it
          reads and displays the contents of the file at that location
          by examining the filesystem directly.  However, Subversion's
          resources exist in a virtual filesystem (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.developer.layerlib.repos" title="Repository Layer">the section called âRepository Layerâ</a>), and your browser
          will not understand how to interact with that
          filesystem.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>The Subversion client will automatically encode URLs as
        necessary, just like a web browser does.  For example, the URL
        <code class="literal">http://host/path with space/project/espaÃ±a</code>
        â which contains both spaces and upper-ASCII characters
        â will be automatically interpreted by Subversion as if
        you'd provided
        <code class="literal">http://host/path%20with%20space/project/espa%C3%B1a</code>.
        If the URL contains spaces, be sure to place it within
        quotation marks at the command line so that your shell treats
        the whole thing as a single argument to the program.</p><p>There is one notable exception to Subversion's handling of
        URLs which also applies to its handling of local paths in many
        contexts, too.  If the final path component of your URL or
        local path contains an at sign (<code class="literal">@</code>), you need
        to use a special syntaxâdescribed in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.pegrevs" title="Peg and Operative Revisions">the section called âPeg and Operative Revisionsâ</a>âin order to make
        Subversion properly address that resource.</p><p>In Subversion 1.6, a new caret (<code class="literal">^</code>)
        notation was introduced as a shorthand for <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">the URL of
        the repository's root directory</span>â</span>.  For example, you can
        use the <code class="literal">^/tags/bigsandwich/</code> to refer to the
        URL of the <code class="filename">/tags/bigsandwich</code> directory in
        the root of the repository.  Note that this URL syntax works
        only when your current working directory is a working
        copyâthe command-line client knows the repository's root
        URL by looking at the working copy's metadata.  Also note that
        when you wish to refer precisely to the root directory of the
        repository, you must do so using <code class="literal">^/</code> (with
        the trailing slash character), not merely
        <code class="literal">^</code>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Subversion Working Copies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.wc"></a>Subversion Working Copies</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32512592" class="indexterm"></a><p>A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on
        your local system, containing a collection of files.  You can
        edit these files however you wish, and if they're source code
        files, you can compile your program from them in the usual
        way.  Your working copy is your own private work area:
        Subversion will never incorporate other people's changes, nor
        make your own changes available to others, until you
        explicitly tell it to do so.  You can even have multiple
        working copies of the same project.</p><p>After you've made some changes to the files in your
        working copy and verified that they work properly, Subversion
        provides you with commands to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">publish</span>â</span> your
        changes to the other people working with you on your project
        (by writing to the repository).  If other people publish their
        own changes, Subversion provides you with commands to merge
        those changes into your working copy (by reading from the
        repository).</p><p>A working copy also contains some extra files, created and
        maintained by Subversion, to help it carry out these commands.
        In particular, each working copy contains a subdirectory
        named <code class="filename">.svn</code>, also known as the working
        copy's <em class="firstterm">administrative directory</em>.  The
        files in the administrative directory help Subversion

          source code) for several projects; usually, each project is a
          subdirectory in the repository's filesystem tree.  In this
          arrangement, a user's working copy will usually correspond to
          a particular subtree of the repository.</p><p>For example, suppose you have a repository that contains
          two software projects, <code class="literal">paint</code> and
          <code class="literal">calc</code>.  Each project lives in its own
          top-level subdirectory, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 1.7.Â The repository's filesystem">FigureÂ 1.7, âThe repository's filesystemâ</a>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 1.7.Â The repository's filesystem</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch02dia6.png" alt="The repository's filesystem"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br><a id="idp32550672" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32552448" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32553840" class="indexterm"></a><p>To get a working copy, you must <em class="firstterm">check
          out</em> some subtree of the repository.  (The term
          <span class="emphasis"><em>check out</em></span> may sound like it has something to do
          with locking or reserving resources, but it doesn't; it simply
          creates a working copy of the project for you.)  For example,
          if you check out <code class="filename">/calc</code>, you will get a
          working copy like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
A    calc/Makefile
A    calc/integer.c
A    calc/button.c

$ ls -A calc
Makefile  button.c integer.c .svn/
$
</pre></div><p>The list of letter <code class="literal">A</code>s in the left
          margin indicates that Subversion is adding a number of items
          to your working copy.  You now have a personal copy of the
          repository's <code class="filename">/calc</code> directory, with one
          additional entryâ<code class="filename">.svn</code>âwhich
          holds the extra information needed by Subversion, as mentioned
          earlier.</p><p>Suppose you make changes to <code class="filename">button.c</code>.
          Since the <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory remembers the
          file's original modification date and contents, Subversion can
          tell that you've changed the file.  However, Subversion does
          not make your changes public until you explicitly tell it to.
          The act of publishing your changes is more commonly known as
          <em class="firstterm">committing</em> (or <em class="firstterm">checking
          in</em>) changes to the repository.</p><a id="idp32563728" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32565504" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32566896" class="indexterm"></a><p>To publish your changes to others, you can use
          Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

$
</pre></div><p>Now your changes to <code class="filename">button.c</code> have
          been committed to the repository, with a note describing your
          change (namely, that you fixed a typo).  If another user
          checks out a working copy of <code class="filename">/calc</code>, she
          will see your changes in the latest version of the
          file.</p><p>Suppose you have a collaborator, Sally, who checked out a
          working copy of <code class="filename">/calc</code> at the same time
          you did.  When you commit your change to
          <code class="filename">button.c</code>, Sally's working copy is left
          unchanged; Subversion modifies working copies only at the
          user's request.</p><a id="idp32574432" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32576208" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32577600" class="indexterm"></a><p>To bring her project up to date, Sally can ask Subversion
          to <em class="firstterm">update</em> her working copy, by using
          the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command.  This will incorporate
          your changes into her working copy, as well as any others that
          have been committed since she checked it out.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  Note that Sally didn't need to
          specify which files to update; Subversion uses the information
          in the <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory as well as further
          information in the repository, to decide which files need to
          be brought up to date.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Mixed-revision working copies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs"></a>Mixed-revision working copies</h4></div></div></div><a id="idp32585776" class="indexterm"></a><p>As a general principle, Subversion tries to be as flexible
          as possible.  One special kind of flexibility is the ability
          to have a working copy containing files and directories with a
          mix of different working revision numbers.  Subversion working
          copies do not always correspond to any single revision in the
          repository; they may contain files from several different
          revisions.  For example, suppose you check out a working copy
          from a repository whose most recent revision is 4:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
calc/<br></br>
Â Â Â Makefile:4<br></br>
Â Â Â integer.c:4<br></br>
Â Â Â button.c:4<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>At the moment, this working directory corresponds exactly
          to revision 4 in the repository.  However, suppose you make a
          change to <code class="filename">button.c</code>, and commit that
          change.  Assuming no other commits have taken place, your
          commit will create revision 5 of the repository, and your
          working copy will now look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
calc/<br></br>
Â Â Â Makefile:4<br></br>
Â Â Â integer.c:4<br></br>
Â Â Â button.c:5<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>Suppose that, at this point, Sally commits a change to
          <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, creating revision 6.  If you
          use <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working copy
          up to date, it will look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
calc/<br></br>
Â Â Â Makefile:6<br></br>
Â Â Â integer.c:6<br></br>
Â Â Â button.c:6<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>Sally's change to <code class="filename">integer.c</code> will
          appear in your working copy, and your change will still be
          present in <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  In this example,
          the text of <code class="filename">Makefile</code> is identical in
          revisions 4, 5, and 6, but Subversion will mark your working
          copy of <code class="filename">Makefile</code> with revision 6 to
          indicate that it is still current.  So, after you do a clean
          update at the top of your working copy, it will generally
          correspond to exactly one revision in the repository.</p><div class="sect4" title="Updates and commits are separate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit"></a>Updates and commits are separate</h5></div></div></div><p>One of the fundamental rules of Subversion is that
            a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">push</span>â</span> action does not cause
            a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pull</span>â</span> nor vice versa.  Just
            because you're ready to submit new changes to the repository
            doesn't mean you're ready to receive changes from other
            people.  And if you have new changes still in progress,
            <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> should gracefully merge
            repository changes into your own, rather than forcing you to
            publish them.</p><p>The main side effect of this rule is that it means a
            working copy has to do extra bookkeeping to track mixed
            revisions as well as be tolerant of the mixture.  It's made
            more complicated by the fact that directories themselves are
            versioned.</p><p>For example, suppose you have a working copy entirely at
            revision 10.  You edit the
            file <code class="filename">foo.html</code> and then perform
            an <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>, which creates revision 15
            in the repository.  After the commit succeeds, many new
            users would expect the working copy to be entirely at
            revision 15, but that's not the case!  Any number of changes
            might have happened in the repository between revisions 10
            and 15.  The client knows nothing of those changes in the
            repository, since you haven't yet run <span class="command"><strong>svn
            update</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> doesn't
            pull down new changes.  If, on the other hand,
            <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> were to automatically download
            the newest changes, it would be possible to set the
            entire working copy to revision 15âbut then we'd be
            breaking the fundamental rule of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">push</span>â</span>
            and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pull</span>â</span> remaining separate actions.
            Therefore, the only safe thing the Subversion client can do
            is mark the one
            fileâ<code class="filename">foo.html</code>âas being at
            revision 15.  The rest of the working copy remains at
            revision 10.  Only by running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
            can the latest changes be downloaded and the whole working
            copy be marked as revision 15.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Mixed revisions are normal"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.normal"></a>Mixed revisions are normal</h5></div></div></div><p>The fact is, <span class="emphasis"><em>every time</em></span> you run
            <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> your working copy ends up
            with some mixture of revisions.  The things you just
            committed are marked as having larger working revisions than
            everything else.  After several commits (with no updates
            in between), your working copy will contain a whole mixture
            of revisions.  Even if you're the only person using the
            repository, you will still see this phenomenon.  To examine
            your mixture of working revisions, use the <span class="command"><strong>svn
            status</strong></span> command with the <code class="option">--verbose</code>
            (<code class="option">-v</code>) option (see
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.examine.status" title="See an overview of your changes">the section called âSee an overview of your changesâ</a> for more
            information).</p><p>Often, new users are completely unaware that their
            working copy contains mixed revisions.  This can be
            confusing, because many client commands are sensitive to the
            working revision of the item they're examining.  For
            example, the <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command is used to
            display the history of changes to a file or directory (see
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.history.log" title="Generating a List of Historical Changes">the section called âGenerating a List of Historical Changesâ</a>).  When the user
            invokes this command on a working copy object, he expects
            to see the entire history of the object.  But if the
            object's working revision is quite old (often because
            <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> hasn't been run in a long
            time), the history of the <span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span>
            version of the object is shown.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Mixed revisions are useful"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.useful"></a>Mixed revisions are useful</h5></div></div></div><p>If your project is sufficiently complex, you'll discover
            that it's sometimes nice to
            forcibly <em class="firstterm">backdate</em> (or update to a
            revision older than the one you already have) portions of
            your working copy to an earlier revision; you'll learn how
            to do that in <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour" title="ChapterÂ 2.Â Basic Usage">ChapterÂ 2, <em>Basic Usage</em></a>.  Perhaps you'd
            like to test an earlier version of a submodule contained in
            a subdirectory, or perhaps you'd like to figure out when a
            bug first came into existence in a specific file.  This is
            the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">time machine</span>â</span> aspect of a version control
            systemâthe feature that allows you to move any
            portion of your working copy forward and backward in
            history.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Mixed revisions have limitations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.limits"></a>Mixed revisions have limitations</h5></div></div></div><p>However you make use of mixed revisions in your working
            copy, there are limitations to this flexibility.</p><p>First, you cannot commit the deletion of a file or
            directory that isn't fully up to date.  If a newer version
            of the item exists in the repository, your attempt to delete
            will be rejected to prevent you from accidentally
            destroying changes you've not yet seen.</p><p>Second, you cannot commit a metadata change to a
            directory unless it's fully up to date.  You'll learn about
            attaching <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">properties</span>â</span> to items in <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced" title="ChapterÂ 3.Â Advanced Topics">ChapterÂ 3, <em>Advanced Topics</em></a>.  A directory's working revision
            defines a specific set of entries and properties, and thus
            committing a property change to an out-of-date directory may
            destroy properties you've not yet seen.</p><p>Finally, beginning in Subversion 1.7, you cannot by
            default use a mixed-revision working copy as the target of
            a merge operation.  (This new requirement was introduced
            to prevent common problems which stem from doing so.)</p></div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.basic.summary"></a>Summary</h2></div></div></div><p>We covered a number of fundamental Subversion concepts in

    Let's move now into the details of using Subversion.  By the time
    you reach the end of this chapter, you will be able to perform all
    the tasks you need to use Subversion in a normal day's work.
    You'll start with getting your files into Subversion, followed by
    an initial checkout of your code.  We'll then walk you through
    making changes and examining those changes.  You'll also see how
    to bring changes made by others into your working copy, examine
    them, and work through any conflicts that might arise.</p><p>This chapter will not provide exhaustive coverage
    of all of Subversion's commandsârather, it's a conversational
    introduction to the most common Subversion tasks that you'll
    encounter.  This chapter assumes that you've read and understood
    <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic" title="ChapterÂ 1.Â Fundamental Concepts">ChapterÂ 1, <em>Fundamental Concepts</em></a> and are familiar with the general
    model of Subversion.  For a complete reference of all commands,
    see <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.</p><p>Also, this chapter assumes that the reader is seeking
    information about how to interact in a basic fashion with an
    existing Subversion repository.  No repository means no working
    copy; no working copy means not much of interest in this chapter.
    There are many Internet sites which offer free or inexpensive
    Subversion repository hosting services.  Or, if you'd prefer to
    set up and administer your own repositories, check out
    <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin" title="ChapterÂ 5.Â Repository Administration">ChapterÂ 5, <em>Repository Administration</em></a>.  But don't expect the
    examples in this chapter to work without the user having access
    to a Subversion repository.</p><p>Finally, any Subversion operation that contacts the repository
    over a network may potentially require that the user authenticate.
    For the sake of simplicity, our examples throughout this chapter
    avoid demonstrating and discussing authentication.  Be aware that
    if you hope to apply the knowledge herein to an existing,
    real-world Subversion instance, you'll probably be forced to
    provide at least a username and password to the server.  See
    <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.creds" title="Client Credentials">the section called âClient Credentialsâ</a> for a detailed
    description of Subversion's handling of authentication and client
    credentials.</p><div class="sect1" title="Help!"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.tour.help"></a>Help!</h2></div></div></div><a id="idp32893056" class="indexterm"></a><p>It goes without saying that this book exists to be a source
      of information and assistance for Subversion users new and old.
      Conveniently, though, the Subversion command-line is
      self-documenting, alleviating the need to grab a book off the
      shelf (wooden, virtual, or otherwise).  The <span class="command"><strong>svn
      help</strong></span> command is your gateway to that built-in
      documentation:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn help
Subversion command-line client, version 1.7.0.
Type 'svn help &lt;subcommand&gt;' for help on a specific subcommand.
Type 'svn --version' to see the program version and RA modules
  or 'svn --version --quiet' to see just the version number.

Most subcommands take file and/or directory arguments, recursing
on the directories.  If no arguments are supplied to such a
command, it recurses on the current directory (inclusive) by default.

Available subcommands:
   add
   blame (praise, annotate, ann)
   cat
â¦
</pre></div><p>As described in the previous output, you can ask for help on
      a particular subcommand by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help
      <em class="replaceable"><code>SUBCOMMAND</code></em></code></strong>.  Subversion
      will respond with the full usage message for that subcommand,
      including its syntax, options, and behavior:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn help help
help (?, h): Describe the usage of this program or its subcommands.
usage: help [SUBCOMMAND...]

        modifiers.  Some folks refer to such things
        as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">switches</span>â</span> or <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">flags</span>â</span>âin
        this book, we'll call them <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">options</span>â</span>.  You'll
        find the options supported by a given <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        subcommand, plus a set of options which are globally supported
        by all subcommands, listed near the bottom of the built-in
        usage message for that subcommand.</p><p>Subversion's options have two distinct forms:  short
        options are a single hyphen followed by a single letter, and
        long options consist of two hyphens followed by several
        letters and hyphens (e.g., <code class="literal">-s</code>
        and <code class="literal">--this-is-a-long-option</code>, respectively).
        Every option has at least one long format.  Some, such as
        the <code class="option">--changelist</code> option, feature an
        abbreviated long-format alias (<code class="option">--cl</code>, in this
        case).  Only certain optionsâgenerally the most-used
        onesâhave an additional short format.  To maintain
        clarity in this book, we usually use the long form in code
        examples, but when describing options, if there's a short
        form, we'll provide the long form (to improve clarity) and the
        short form (to make it easier to remember).  Use the form
        you're more comfortable with when executing your own
        Subversion commands.</p></div><p>Many Unix-based distributions of Subversion include manual
      pages of the sort that can be invoked using
      the <span class="command"><strong>man</strong></span> program, but those tend to carry only
      pointers to other sources of real help, such as the project's
      website and to the website which hosts this book.  Also, several
      companies offer Subversion help and support, too, usually via a
      mixture of web-based discussion forums and fee-based consulting.
      And of course, the Internet holds a decade's worth of
      Subversion-related discussions just begging to be located by
      your favorite search engine.  Subversion help is never too far
      away.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Getting Data into Your Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.tour.importing"></a>Getting Data into Your Repository</h2></div></div></div><p>You can get new files into your Subversion
      repository in two ways: <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      add</strong></span>.  We'll discuss <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> now
      and will discuss <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> later in this
      chapter when we review a typical day with Subversion.</p><div class="sect2" title="Importing Files and Directories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.importing.import"></a>Importing Files and Directories</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32916528" class="indexterm"></a><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> command is a quick way to
        copy an unversioned tree of files into a repository, creating
        intermediate directories as necessary.  <span class="command"><strong>svn
        import</strong></span> doesn't require a working copy, and your files
        are immediately committed to the repository.  You typically
        use this when you have an existing tree of files that you want to
        begin tracking in your Subversion repository.  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn import /path/to/mytree \
             http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/some/project \
             -m "Initial import"
Adding         mytree/foo.c
Adding         mytree/bar.c
Adding         mytree/subdir
Adding         mytree/subdir/quux.h

Committed revision 1.
$
</pre></div><p>The previous example copied the contents of the local
        directory <code class="filename">mytree</code> into the directory
        <code class="filename">some/project</code> in the repository.  Note
        that you didn't have to create that new directory
        firstâ<span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> does that for you.
        Immediately after the commit, you can see your data in the
        repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn list http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/some/project
bar.c
foo.c
subdir/
$
</pre></div><p>Note that after the import is finished, the original local
        directory is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> converted into a working
        copy.  To begin working on that data in a versioned fashion,
        you still need to create a fresh working copy of that
        tree.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Recommended Repository Layout"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.importing.layout"></a>Recommended Repository Layout</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32927760" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32928768" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32929776" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp32930784" class="indexterm"></a><p>Subversion provides the ultimate flexibility in terms of
        how you arrange your data.  Because it simply versions
        directories and files, and because it ascribes no particular
        meaning to any of those objects, you may arrange the data in
        your repository in any way that you choose.  Unfortunately,
        this flexibility also means that it's easy to find
        yourself <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">lost without a roadmap</span>â</span> as you attempt
        to navigate different Subversion repositories which may carry
        completely different and unpredictable arrangements of the
        data within them.</p><p>To counteract this confusion, we recommend that you follow
        a repository layout convention (established long ago, in the
        nascency of the Subversion project itself) in which a handful
        of strategically named Subversion repository directories
        convey valuable meaning about the data they hold.  Most
        projects have a recognizable <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">main line</span>â</span>,
        or <em class="firstterm">trunk</em>, of development;
        some <em class="firstterm">branches</em>, which are divergent
        copies of development lines; and
        some <em class="firstterm">tags</em>, which are named, stable
        snapshots of a particular line of development.  So we first
        recommend that each project have a
        recognizable <em class="firstterm">project root</em> in the
        repository, a directory under which all of the versioned
        information for that projectâand only that
        projectâlives.  Secondly, we suggest that each project
        root contain a <code class="filename">trunk</code> subdirectory for the
        main development line, a
        <code class="filename">branches</code> subdirectory in which specific
        branches (or collections of branches) will be created, and
        a <code class="filename">tags</code> subdirectory in which specific
        tags (or collections of tags) will be created.  Of course, if
        a repository houses only a single project, the root of the
        repository can serve as the project root, too.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn list file:///var/svn/single-project-repo
trunk/
branches/
tags/
$ svn list file:///var/svn/multi-project-repo
project-A/
project-B/
$ svn list file:///var/svn/multi-project-repo/project-A
trunk/
branches/
tags/
$
</pre></div><p>We talk much more about tags and branches in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge" title="ChapterÂ 4.Â Branching and Merging">ChapterÂ 4, <em>Branching and Merging</em></a>.  For details and some
        advice on how to set up repositories when you have multiple
        projects, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.maint.layout" title="Repository Layout">the section called âRepository Layoutâ</a>.
        Finally, we discuss project roots more in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="Planning Your Repository Organization">the section called âPlanning Your Repository Organizationâ</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="What's In a Name?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.importing.naming"></a>What's In a Name?</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you
        can place under version control.  The contents of files and
        property values are stored and transmitted as binary data, and
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called âFile Content Typeâ</a>
        tells you how to give Subversion a hint that
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">textual</span>â</span> operations don't make sense for a
        particular file.  There are a few places, however, where
        Subversion places restrictions on information it
        stores.</p><p>Subversion internally handles certain bits of
        dataâfor example, property names, pathnames, and log
        messagesâas UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  This is not to say
        that all your interactions with Subversion must involve UTF-8,
        though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will gracefully
        and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
        encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion
        can meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common
        encodings in use today).</p><p>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of
        Subversion's administrative files, paths are used as XML
        attribute values, and property names in XML tag names.  This
        means that pathnames can contain only legal XML (1.0)
        characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
        characters.  Subversion also prohibits <code class="literal">TAB</code>,
        <code class="literal">CR</code>, and <code class="literal">LF</code> characters in
        path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or
        in the output of commands such as <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>
        or <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.</p><p>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice
        these limitations are rarely a problem.  As long as your
        locale settings are compatible with UTF-8 and you don't use
        control characters in path names, you should have no trouble
        communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds
        an extra bit of helpâto create
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">legally correct</span>â</span> versions for internal
        use it will automatically escape illegal
        path characters as needed in URLs that you type.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Creating a Working Copy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.tour.initial"></a>Creating a Working Copy</h2></div></div></div><a id="idp32953936" class="indexterm"></a><p>Most of the time, you will start using a Subversion
      repository by performing a <em class="firstterm">checkout</em> of
      your project.  Checking out a directory from a repository
      creates a working copy of that directory on your local machine.
      Unless otherwise specified, this copy contains the youngest
      (that is, most recently created or modified) versions of the
      directory and its children found in the Subversion
      repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk
A    trunk/README
A    trunk/INSTALL
A    trunk/src/main.c
A    trunk/src/header.h
â¦
Checked out revision 8810.
$
</pre></div><p>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk
      directory, you can just as easily check out a deeper
      subdirectory of a repository by specifying that subdirectory's
      URL as the checkout URL:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/trunk/src

      lock-modify-unlock (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.vsn-models" title="Versioning Models">the section called âVersioning Modelsâ</a>),
      you can immediately make changes to the files and directories in
      your working copy.  Your working copy is just like any other
      collection of files and directories on your system.  You can
      edit the files inside it, rename it, even delete the entire
      working copy and forget about it.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While your working copy is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">just like any other

        you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
        about <span class="emphasis"><em>everything else</em></span> that you do.  For
        example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
        copy, you should use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> or
        <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> instead of the copy and move

        version 1.7, every versioned subdirectory
        thereofâcontains a special administrative subdirectory
        named <code class="filename">.svn</code>.  Usually, your operating
        system's directory listing commands won't show this
        subdirectory, but it is nevertheless an important directory.
        Whatever you do, don't delete or change anything in the
        administrative area!  Subversion uses that directory and its
        contents to manage your working copy.</p></div><p>Notice that in the previous pair of examples, Subversion
      chose to create a working copy in a directory named for the
      final component of the checkout URL.  This occurs only as a
      convenience to the user when the checkout URL is the only bit of
      information provided to the <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>
      command.  Subversion's command-line client gives you additional
      flexibility, though, allowing you to optionally specify the
      local directory name that Subversion should use for the working
      copy it creates.  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

      whistles, but on a day-to-day basis, odds are that you will use
      only a few of them.  In this section, we'll run through the most
      common things that you might find yourself doing with Subversion
      in the course of a day's work.</p><p>The typical work cycle looks like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Update your working copy.</em></span> This
          involves the use of the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
          command.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Make your changes.</em></span> The most common
          changes that you'll make are edits to the contents of your
          existing files.  But sometimes you need to add, remove, copy
          and move files and directoriesâthe <span class="command"><strong>svn
          add</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          copy</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> commands
          handle those sorts of structural changes within the working
          copy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Review your changes.</em></span>
          The <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          diff</strong></span> commands are critical to reviewing the
          changes you've made in your working copy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Fix your mistakes.</em></span>  Nobody's
          perfect, so as you review your changes, you may spot
          something that's not quite right.  Sometimes the easiest way
          to fix a mistake is start all over again from scratch.
          The <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command restores a file
          or directory to its unmodified state.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Resolve any conflicts (merge others'
          changes).</em></span>  In the time it takes you to make and
          review your changes, others might have made and published
          changes, too.  You'll want to integrate their changes into
          your working copy to avoid the potential out-of-dateness
          scenarios when you attempt to publish your own.  Again,
          the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command is the way to do
          this.  If this results in local conflicts, you'll need to
          resolve those using the <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>
          command.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Publish (commit) your changes.</em></span>
          The <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command transmits your
          changes to the repository where, if they are accepted, they
          create the newest versions of all the things you modified.
          Now others can see your work, too!</p></li></ol></div><div class="sect2" title="Update Your Working Copy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.update"></a>Update Your Working Copy</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp32991152" class="indexterm"></a><p>When working on a project that is being modified via
        multiple working copies, you'll want to update your working
        copy to receive any changes committed from other working
        copies since your last update.  These might be changes that
        other members of your project team have made, or they might
        simply be changes you've made yourself from a different
        computer.  To protect your data, Subversion won't
        allow you commit new changes to out-of-date files and
        directories, so it's best to have the latest versions
        of all your project's files and directories before making new
        changes of your own.</p><p>Use <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working
        copy into sync with the latest revision in the
        repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn update
Updating '.':
U    foo.c
U    bar.c
Updated to revision 2.
$
</pre></div><p>In this case, it appears that someone checked in
        modifications to both <code class="filename">foo.c</code>
        and <code class="filename">bar.c</code> since the last time you
        updated, and Subversion has updated your working copy to
        include those changes.</p><p>When the server sends changes to your working copy via
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, a letter code is displayed next
        to each item to let you know what actions Subversion performed
        to bring your working copy up to date.  To find out what these
        letters mean, run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn help update</code></strong> or
        see <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svn.c.update" title="svn update (up)">svn update (up)</a> in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Make Your Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.edit"></a>Make Your Changes </h3></div></div></div><p>Now you can get to work and make changes in your working
        copy.  You can make two kinds of changes to your working
        copy: <em class="firstterm">file changes</em> and <em class="firstterm">tree
        changes</em>.  You don't need to tell Subversion that
        you intend to change a file; just make your changes using your
        text editor, word processor, graphics program, or whatever
        tool you would normally use.  Subversion automatically detects
        which files have been changed, and in addition, it handles
        binary files just as easily as it handles text filesâand
        just as efficiently, too.  Tree changes are different, and
        involve changes to a directory's structure.  Such changes
        include adding and removing files, renaming files or
        directories, and copying files or directories to new
        locations.  For tree changes, you use Subversion operations
        to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">schedule</span>â</span> files and directories for removal,
        addition, copying, or moving.  These changes may take place
        immediately in your working copy, but no additions or removals
        will happen in the repository until you commit them.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Versioning Symbolic Links"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Versioning Symbolic Links</strong></p></div></div></div><p>On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version
          files of the special type <em class="firstterm">symbolic
          link</em> (or <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">symlink</span>â</span>).  A symlink is
          a file that acts as a sort of transparent reference to some
          other object in the filesystem, allowing programs to read
          and write to those objects indirectly by performing
          operations on the symlink itself.</p><p>When a symlink is committed into a Subversion
          repository, Subversion remembers that the file was in fact a
          symlink, as well as the object to which the symlink
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">points.</span>â</span>  When that symlink is checked out to
          another working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion
          reconstructs a real filesystem-level symbolic link from the
          versioned symlink.  But that doesn't in any way limit the
          usability of working copies on systems such as Windows that
          do not support symlinks.  On such systems, Subversion simply
          creates a regular text file whose contents are the path to
          which the original symlink pointed.  While that file
          can't be used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also
          won't prevent Windows users from performing their other
          Subversion-related activities.</p></div><p>Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands
        that you'll use most often to make tree changes:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><strong class="userinput"><code>svn add FOO</code></strong></span></dt><dd><a id="idp33012432" class="indexterm"></a><p>Use this to schedule the file, directory, or

              its parent directory.  Note that if
              <code class="filename">FOO</code> is a directory, everything
              underneath <code class="filename">FOO</code> will be scheduled
              for addition.  If you want only to add
              <code class="filename">FOO</code> itself, pass the

              file or link, it is immediately deleted from your
              working copy.  If <code class="filename">FOO</code> is a
              directory, it is not deleted, but Subversion schedules
              it for deletion.  When you commit your
              changes, <code class="filename">FOO</code> will be entirely
              removed from your working copy and the

          immediately commit tree changes to the repository without an
          explicit commit action.  In particular, specific uses
          of <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>, and
          <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> can operate directly on
          repository URLs as well as on working copy paths.  Of
          course, as previously mentioned, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          import</strong></span> always makes direct changes to the
          repository.</p><p>There are pros and cons to performing URL-based
          operations.  One obvious advantage to doing so is speed:
          sometimes, checking out a working copy that you don't
          already have solely to perform some seemingly simple action
          is an overbearing cost.  A disadvantage is that you are
          generally limited to a single, or single type of, operation
          at a time when operating directly on URLs.  Finally, the
          primary advantage of a working copy is in its utility as a
          sort of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">staging area</span>â</span> for changes.  You can
          make sure that the changes you are about to commit make
          sense in the larger scope of your project before committing
          them.  And, of course, these staged changes can be as
          complex or as a simple as they need to be, yet result in but
          a single new revision when committed.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Review Your Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.examine"></a>Review Your Changes</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp33056816" class="indexterm"></a><p>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can compose a
        more accurate <em class="firstterm">log message</em> (a
        human-readable description of the committed changes stored
        alongside those changes in the repository).  You may also
        discover that you've inadvertently changed a file, and that
        you need to undo that change before committing.  Additionally,
        this is a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes
        before publishing them.  You can see an overview of the
        changes you've made by using the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
        command, and you can dig into the details of those changes by
        using the <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> command.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Look Ma! No Network!"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Look Ma! No Network!</strong></p></div></div></div><p>You can use the commands <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          revert</strong></span> without any network access even if your
          repository <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> across the network.  This
          makes it easy to manage and review your changes-in-progress
          when you are working offline or are otherwise unable to
          contact your repository over the network.</p><a id="idp33064224" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp33065232" class="indexterm"></a><p>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine, unmodified versions of each versioned file inside
          its working copy administrative area (or prior to version 1.7,
          potentially multiple administrative areas).  This allows
          Subversion to reportâand revertâlocal
          modifications to those files <span class="emphasis"><em>without network
          access</em></span>.  This cache (called the
          <em class="firstterm">text-base</em>) also allows Subversion to
          send the user's local modifications during a commit to the
          server as a compressed <em class="firstterm">delta</em> (or
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">difference</span>â</span>) against the pristine version.
          Having this cache is a tremendous benefitâeven if you
          have a fast Internet connection, it's generally much faster
          to send only a file's changes rather than the whole file to
          the server.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="See an overview of your changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.examine.status"></a>See an overview of your changes</h4></div></div></div><a id="idp33070336" class="indexterm"></a><p>To get an overview of your changes, use the

          output by comparing your working files against its pristine
          text-base.  Files scheduled for addition are displayed as
          files in which every line was added; files scheduled for
          deletion are displayed as if every line was removed from
          those files.  The output from <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> is
          somehwat compatible with the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span>
          programâmore so with the <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span>
          subcommand introduced in Subversion 1.7.  Patch processing
          commands such as these read and apply <em class="firstterm">patch
          files</em> (or <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">patches</span>â</span>), which are
          files that describe differences made to one or more files.
          Because of this, you can share the changes you've made in
          your working copy with someone else without first committing
          those changes by creating a patch file from the redirected
          output of <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn diff &gt; patchfile

</pre></div><p>Subversion uses its internal diff engine, which produces
          unified diff format, by default.  If you want diff output in
          a different format, specify an external diff program using
          <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and pass any additional flags
          that it needs via the <code class="option">--extensions</code>
          (<code class="option">-x</code>) option.  For example, you might want
          Subversion to defer its difference calculation and display
          to the GNU <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> program, asking that
          program to print local modifications made to the
          file <code class="filename">foo.c</code> in context diff format
          (another flavor of difference format) while ignoring changes
          made only to the case of the letters used in the file's
          contents:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        diff</strong></span> you determine that all the changes you made to
        a particular file are mistakes.  Maybe you shouldn't have
        changed the file at all, or perhaps it would be easier to make
        different changes starting from scratch.  You could edit the
        file again and unmake all those changes.  You could try to
        find a copy of how the file looked before you changed it, and
        then copy its contents atop your modified version.  You
        could attempt to apply those changes to the file again in
        reverse using <strong class="userinput"><code>patch -R</code></strong>.  And there are
        probably other approaches you could take.</p><a id="idp33151088" class="indexterm"></a><p>Fortunately in Subversion, undoing your work and starting
        over from scratch doesn't require such acrobatics.  Just use
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status README
M       README
$ svn revert README
Reverted 'README'
$ svn status README
$
</pre></div><p>In this example, Subversion has reverted the file to its
        premodified state by overwriting it with the pristine version
        of the file cached in the text-base area.  But note that
        <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> can undo
        <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> scheduled operationâfor
        example, you might decide that you don't want to add a new
        file after all:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status new-file.txt
?       new-file.txt
$ svn add new-file.txt

$ svn revert new-file.txt
Reverted 'new-file.txt'
$ svn status new-file.txt
?       new-file.txt

        control:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status README
$ svn delete README

$ svn revert README
Reverted 'README'

$
</pre></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command offers salvation
        for imperfect people.  It can save you huge amounts of time
        and energy that would otherwise be spent manually unmaking
        changes or, worse, disposing of your working copy and checking
        out a fresh one just to have a clean slate to work with
        again.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Resolve Any Conflicts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cycle.resolve"></a>Resolve Any Conflicts</h3></div></div></div><a id="idp33162464" class="indexterm"></a><p>We've already seen how <strong class="userinput"><code>svn status
        -u</code></strong> can predict conflicts, but dealing with those
        conflicts is still something that remains to be done.
        Conflicts can occur any time you attempt to merge or integrate
        (in a very general sense) changes from the repository into
        your working copy.  By now you know that <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> creates exactly that sort of
        scenarioâthat command's very purpose is to bring your
        working copy up to date with the repository by merging all the
        changes made since your last update into your working
        copy.  So how does Subversion report these conflicts to you,
        and how do you deal with them?</p><p>Suppose you run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong> and you
        see this sort of interesting output:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        (for <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">merGed</span>â</span>) codes are no cause for concern;
        those files cleanly absorbed changes from the repository.  A
        file marked with <code class="computeroutput">U</code> contains
        no local changes but was updated with changes from the
        repository.  One marked with
        <code class="computeroutput">G</code> had local changes to begin
        with, but the changes coming from the repository didn't
        overlap with those local changes.</p><p>It's the next few lines which are interesting.  First,
        Subversion reports to you that in its attempt to merge
        outstanding server changes into the
        file <code class="filename">bar.c</code>, it has detected that some of
        those changes clash with local modifications you've made to
        that file in your working copy but have not yet committed.
        Perhaps someone has changed the same line of text you also
        changed.  Whatever the reason, Subversion instantly flags this
        file as being in a state of conflict.  It then asks you what
        you want to do about the problem, allowing you to
        interactively choose an action to take toward resolving the
        conflict.  The most commonly used options are displayed, but
        you can see all of the options by

          format for the conflict regions which allows you to more
          easily compare the file's contents in those regions as they

          interactivelyâtwo of which allow you to selectively
          merge and edit changes, the rest of which allow you to
          simply pick a version of the file and move along.</p><p>If you wish to choose some combination of your local
          changes, you can use the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">edit</span>â</span> command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>e</code></strong>) to manually edit the file with
          conflict markers in a text editor (configured per the
          instructions in <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externaleditors" title="Using External Editors">the section called âUsing External Editorsâ</a>).  After you've edited the file, if you're satisfied with
          the changes you've made, you can tell Subversion that the
          edited file is no longer in conflict by using
          the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">resolved</span>â</span> command
          (<code class="literal">r</code>).</p><p>Regardless of what your local Unix snob will likely tell
          you, editing the file by hand in your favorite text editor
          is a somewhat low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand" title="Merging conflicts by hand">the section called âMerging conflicts by handâ</a> for a
          walkthrough).  For this reason, Subversion provides
          the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">launch</span>â</span> resolution command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>l</code></strong>) to fire up a fancy graphical
          merge tool instead (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externaldifftools.merge" title="External merge">the section called âExternal mergeâ</a>).</p><p>If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes,
          but just want to accept one version of the file or the
          other, you can either choose your changes (a.k.a.
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mine</span>â</span>) by using the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mine-full</span>â</span>
          command (<strong class="userinput"><code>mf</code></strong>) or choose theirs by using the
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">theirs-full</span>â</span> command
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>tf</code></strong>).</p><p>Finally, there is also a pair of compromise options
          available.  The <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mine-conflict</span>â</span>
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>mc</code></strong>)
          and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">theirs-conflict</span>â</span>
          (<strong class="userinput"><code>tc</code></strong>) commands instruct Subversion to
          select your local changes or the server's incoming changes,
          respectively, as the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">winner</span>â</span> for all conflicts
          in the file.  But, unlike the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mine-full</span>â</span>
          and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">theirs-full</span>â</span> commands, these commands

          marital disagreements, but it's actually still about
          Subversion, so read on.  If you're doing an update and
          encounter a conflict that you're not prepared to review or
          resolve, you can type <strong class="userinput"><code>p</code></strong> to postpone
          resolving a conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run
          <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>.  If you know in advance
          that you don't want to resolve any conflicts interactively,
          you can pass the <code class="option">--non-interactive</code> option
          to <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, and any file in conflict
          will be marked with a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
          automatically.</p><p>The <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
          (for <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Conflicted</span>â</span>) means that the changes from the
          server overlapped with your own, and now you have to
          manually choose between them after the update has completed.
          When you postpone a conflict resolution,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> typically does three things to assist
          you in noticing and resolving that conflict:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><a id="idp33239696" class="indexterm"></a><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Subversion prints a <code class="computeroutput">C</code>
              during the update and remembers that the file is in a
              state of conflict.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If Subversion considers the file to be mergeable, it
              places <em class="firstterm">conflict
              markers</em>âspecial strings of text that
              delimit the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">sides</span>â</span> of the
              conflictâinto the file to visibly demonstrate the
              overlapping areas.  (Subversion uses the
              <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to decide whether a
              file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.  See
              <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called âFile Content Typeâ</a>
              to learn more.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For every conflicted file, Subversion places three

                    contains any local modifications you had made to
                    the file up to that point.  (If Subversion
                    considers the file to be unmergeable,
                    the <code class="filename">.mine</code> file isn't created,
                    since it would be identical to the working

          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code>, but does not yet commit
          those changes.  Meanwhile, Harry commits changes to that
          same file.  Sally updates her working copy before committing

          changes.  You'll do this with the <span class="command"><strong>svn

          your edits, choose the <em class="replaceable"><code>mine-full</code></em>
          argument.</p><p>If you want to choose the version that your most recent
          update pulled from the server (and thus discarding your

          first time you attempt it, but with a little practice, it
          can become as easy as falling off a bike.</p><p>Here's an example.  Due to a miscommunication, you and
          Sally, your collaborator, both edit the file
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> at the same time.  Sally
          commits her changes, and when you go to update your working
          copy, you get a conflict and you're going to have to edit
          <code class="filename">sandwich.txt</code> to resolve the conflict.
          First, let's take a look at the file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cat sandwich.txt

Sauerkraut

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2

</pre></div><p>The strings of less-than signs, equals signs, and
          greater-than signs are conflict markers and are not part of
          the actual data in conflict.  You generally want to ensure
          that those are removed from the file before your next
          commit.  The text between the first two sets of markers is
          composed of the changes you made in the conflicting
          area:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella

</pre></div><p>The text between the second and third sets of conflict
          markers is the text from Sally's commit:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
</pre></div><p>Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict
          markers and Sally's changesâshe's going to be awfully
          surprised when the sandwich arrives and it's not what she
          wanted.  This is where you pick up the phone or walk across
          the office and explain to Sally that you can't get
          sauerkraut from an Italian deli.<sup>[<a id="idp33253024" href="#ftn.idp33253024" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>  Once you've agreed on the changes
          you will commit, edit your file and remove the conflict
          markers:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Now use <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, and you're

</pre></div><p>Note that <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span>, unlike most of
          the other commands we deal with in this chapter, requires
          that you explicitly list any filenames that you wish to

          <span class="command"><strong>svn resolve</strong></span> only when you're certain that
          you've fixed the conflict in your fileâonce the
          temporary files are removed, Subversion will let you commit
          the file even if it still contains conflict markers.</p><p>If you ever get confused while editing the conflicted
          file, you can always consult the three files that Subversion
          creates for you in your working copyâincluding your
          file as it was before you updated.  You can even use a
          third-party interactive merging tool to examine those three

        your changes to the repository.  When you commit a change, you
        need to supply a log message describing your change.  Your log
        message will be attached to the new revision you create.  If
        your log message is brief, you may wish to supply it on the

      a single Subversion command, you can check out the repository
      (or restore an existing working copy) exactly as it was at any

          Just Committed?</strong></p></div></div></div><p>If you make a commit and immediately type <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
          log</code></strong> with no arguments, you may notice that your
          most recent commit doesn't show up in the list of log
          messages.  This is due to a combination of the behavior of
          <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> and the default behavior of
          <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>.  First, when you commit changes
          to the repository, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> bumps only the
          revision of files (and directories) that it commits, so
          usually the parent directory remains at the older revision
          (See
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit" title="Updates and commits are separate">the section called âUpdates and commits are separateâ</a>
          for an explanation of why).  <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> then
          defaults to fetching the history of the directory at its
          current revision, and thus you don't see the newly committed
          changes.  The solution here is to either update your working
          copy or explicitly provide a revision number to <span class="command"><strong>svn
          log</strong></span> by using the <code class="option">--revision</code>
          (<code class="option">-r</code>) option.</p></div><p>If you want even more information about a file or
        directory, <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> also takes a
        <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option.
        Because Subversion allows you to move and copy files and
        directories, it is important to be able to track path changes
        in the filesystem.  So, in verbose mode, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        log</strong></span> will include a list of changed paths in a
        revision in its output:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        a <code class="option">--quiet</code> (<code class="option">-q</code>) option, which
        suppresses the body of the log message.  When combined
        with <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>), it
        gives just the names of the changed files.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Why Does svn log Give Me an Empty Response?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Why Does svn log Give Me an Empty
          Response?</strong></p></div></div></div><p>After working with Subversion for a bit, most users will
          come across something like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn log -r 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$
</pre></div><p>At first glance, this seems like an error.  But recall
          that while revisions are repository-wide, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          log</strong></span> operates on a path in the repository.  If you
          supply no path, Subversion uses the current working
          directory as the default target.  As a result, if you're
          operating in a subdirectory of your working copy and attempt
          to see the log of a revision in which neither that directory
          nor any of its children was changed, Subversion will show you
          an empty log.  If you want to see what changed in that
          revision, try pointing <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> directly at
          the topmost URL of your repository, as in <strong class="userinput"><code>svn log
          -r 2 ^/</code></strong>.</p></div><p>As of Subversion 1.7, users of the Subversion command-line
        can also take advantage of a special output mode
        for <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> which integrates a difference
        report such as is generated by the <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>
        command we introduced earlier.  When you invoke <span class="command"><strong>svn
        log</strong></span> with the <code class="option">--diff</code> option,
        Subversion will append to each revision log chunk in the log
        report a <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span>-style difference report.
        This is a very convenient way to see both the high-level, semantic
        changes and the line-based modifications of a revision all at
        the same time!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Browsing the Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.history.browsing"></a>Browsing the Repository</h3></div></div></div><p>Using <span class="command"><strong>svn cat</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        list</strong></span>, you can view various revisions of files and
        directories without changing the working revision of your
        working copy.  In fact, you don't even need a working copy to
        use either one.</p><div class="sect3" title="Displaying file contents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.history.browsing.cat"></a>Displaying file contents</h4></div></div></div><p>If you want to examine an earlier version of a file and

          <span class="command"><strong>svn cat</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 2 rules.txt

</pre></div><p>You can also redirect the output directly into a

          we discussed in the previous section is the <span class="command"><strong>svn
          annotate</strong></span> command.  This command also displays the
          contents of a versioned file, but it does so using a tabular
          format.  Each line of output shows not only a line of the
          file's content but also the username, the revision number
          and (optionally) the datestamp of the revision in which that
          line was last modified.</p><p>When used with a working copy file target, <span class="command"><strong>svn
          annotate</strong></span> will by default show line-by-line
          attribution of the file as it currently appears in the
          working copy.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn annotate rules.txt

     -          - Listen when others are speaking
</pre></div><p>Notice that for some lines, there is no attribution
          provided.  In this case, that's because those lines have
          been modified in the working copy's version of the file.  In
          this way, <span class="command"><strong>svn annotate</strong></span> becomes another
          way for you to see which lines in the file you have
          changed.  You can use the <code class="literal">BASE</code> revision
          keyword (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.revs.keywords" title="Revision Keywords">the section called âRevision Keywordsâ</a>) to
          instead see the unmodified form of the file as it resides
          in your working copy.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>The <code class="option">--verbose (-v)</code> option causes
          <span class="command"><strong>svn annotate</strong></span> to also include on each line
          the datestamp associated with that line's reported revision
          number.  (This adds a significant amount of width to each
          line of ouput, so we'll skip the demonstration here.)</p><p>As with <span class="command"><strong>svn cat</strong></span>, you can also
          ask <span class="command"><strong>svn annotate</strong></span> to display previous
          versions of the file.  This can be a handy trick when, after
          finding out who most recently modified a particular line of
          interest in the file, you then wish to see who modified the
          same line prior to that.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Unlike the <span class="command"><strong>svn cat</strong></span> command, the
          functionality of <span class="command"><strong>svn annotate</strong></span> is tied
          heavily to the idea of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">lines</span>â</span> of text in a
          human-readable file.  As such, if you attempt to run the
          command on a file that Subversion has determined is
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> human-readable (per the file's
          <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> propertyâsee <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called âFile Content Typeâ</a> for
          details), you'll get an error message.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn annotate images/logo.png

$
</pre></div><p>As revealed in the error message, you can use
          the <code class="option">--force</code> option to disable this check
          and proceed with the annotation as if the file's contents
          are, in fact, human-readable and line-based.  Naturally, if
          you force Subversion to try to perform line-based annotation
          on a nontextual file, you'll get what you asked for: a
          screenful of nonsense.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        effect the desired change, holding a lock on the relevant part
        of the working copy while it works.  This prevents other
        Subversion clients from accessing the working copy mid-change.
        Finally, Subversion releases its lock and cleans up its
        private to-do list.  Architecturally, this is similar to a
        journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation is
        interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the private to-do list remains on disk.  This allows
        Subversion to return to that list later to complete any
        unfinished operations and return your working copy to a
        consistent state.</p><p>This is exactly what <span class="command"><strong>svn cleanup</strong></span> does:
        it searches your working copy and runs any leftover to-do
        items, removing working copy locks as it completes those
        operations.  If Subversion ever tells you that some part of
        your working copy is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">locked,</span>â</span> run <span class="command"><strong>svn
        cleanup</strong></span> to remedy the problem.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> command will inform you about administrative
        locks in the working copy, too, by displaying
        an <code class="literal">L</code> next to those locked paths:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
  L     somedir
M       somedir/foo.c
$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M       somedir/foo.c
</pre></div><p>Don't confuse these working copy administrative locks with
        the user-managed locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent version control;
        see the sidebar
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.locking.meanings" title="The Three Meanings of âLockâ">The Three Meanings of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Lock</span>â</span></a> for
        clarification.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Dealing with Structural Conflicts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.tour.treeconflicts"></a>Dealing with Structural Conflicts</h2></div></div></div><p>So far, we have only talked about conflicts at the level of
      file content.  When you and your collaborators make overlapping
      changes within the same file, Subversion forces you to merge
      those changes before you can commit.<sup>[<a id="idp33476928" href="#ftn.idp33476928" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup></p><p>But what happens if your collaborators move or delete a file
      that you are still working on?  Maybe there was a
      miscommunication, and one person thinks the file should be
      deleted, while another person still wants to commit changes to
      the file.  Or maybe your collaborators did some refactoring,
      renaming files and moving around directories in the process.  If
      you were still working on these files, those modifications may
      need to be applied to the files at their new location.  Such
      conflicts manifest themselves at the directory tree structure
      level rather than at the file content level, and are known
      as <em class="firstterm">tree conflicts</em>.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Tree conflicts prior to Subversion 1.6</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Prior to Subversion 1.6, tree conflicts could yield rather
        unexpected results.  For example, if a file was locally
        modified, but had been renamed in the repository,
        running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> would make Subversion
        carry out the following steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Check the file to be renamed for local
          modifications.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete the file at its old location, and if it
          had local modifications, keep an on-disk copy of the file at
          the old location.  This on-disk copy now appears as an
          unversioned file in the working copy.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add the file, as it exists in the repository,
          at its new location.</p></li></ul></div><p>When this situation arises, there is the possibility that
        the user makes a commit without realizing that local
        modifications have been left in a now-unversioned file in the
        working copy, and have not reached the repository.  This gets
        more and more likely (and tedious) if the number of files
        affected by this problem is large.</p><p>Since Subversion 1.6, this and other similar situations
        are flagged as conflicts in the working copy.</p></div><p>As with textual conflicts, tree conflicts prevent a commit
      from being made from the conflicted state, giving the user the
      opportunity to examine the state of the working copy for
      potential problems arising from the tree conflict, and resolving
      any such problems before committing.</p><div class="sect2" title="An Example Tree Conflict"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.treeconflicts.example"></a>An Example Tree Conflict</h3></div></div></div><p>Suppose a software project you were working on currently

    comfortable with submitting and receiving changes using the
    <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
    operations.  You've probably even developed a reflex that causes
    you to run the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> command almost
    unconsciously.  For all intents and purposes, you are ready to
    use Subversion in a typical environment.</p><p>But the Subversion feature set doesn't stop at <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">common
    version control operations.</span>â</span>  It has other bits of
    functionality besides just communicating file and
    directory changes to and from a central repository.</p><p>This chapter highlights some of Subversion's features that,
    while important, may not be part of the typical user's daily routine.
    It assumes that you are familiar with Subversion's basic file and
    directory versioning capabilities.  If you aren't, you'll want to
    first read <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic" title="ChapterÂ 1.Â Fundamental Concepts">ChapterÂ 1, <em>Fundamental Concepts</em></a> and <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour" title="ChapterÂ 2.Â Basic Usage">ChapterÂ 2, <em>Basic Usage</em></a>.  Once you've mastered those basics and
    consumed this chapter, you'll be a Subversion power user!</p><div class="sect1" title="Revision Specifiers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.tour.revs.specifiers"></a>Revision Specifiers</h2></div></div></div><p>As we described in <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.revs" title="Revisions">the section called âRevisionsâ</a>, revision numbers in Subversion are pretty
      straightforwardâintegers that keep getting larger as you
      commit more changes to your versioned data.  Still, it doesn't
      take long before you can no longer remember exactly what
      happened in each and every revision.  Fortunately, the typical
      Subversion workflow doesn't often demand that you supply
      arbitrary revisions to the Subversion operations you perform.
      For operations that <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> require a revision
      specifier, you generally supply a revision number that you saw
      in a commit email, in the output of some other Subversion
      operation, or in some other context that would give meaning to
      that particular number.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Referring to revision numbers with

        practice in Subversion communities, and is both supported and
        encouraged by many Subversion-related tools.  In most places
        where you would specify a bare revision number on the command

      which you don't already have a revision number memorized or
      handy.  So besides the integer revision numbers,
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> allows as input some additional forms of

          specifying a time of day (for example
          <code class="literal">2006-11-27</code>), you may think that Subversion
          should give you the last revision that took place on the
          27th of November.  Instead, you'll get back a revision from
          the 26th, or even earlier.  Remember that Subversion will
          find the <span class="emphasis"><em>most recent revision of the
          repository</em></span> as of the date you give.  If you give
          a date without a timestamp, such as
          <code class="literal">2006-11-27</code>, Subversion assumes a time of
          00:00:00, so looking for the most recent revision won't
          return anything on the 27th.</p><p>If you want to include the 27th in your search, you can

          revision numbers depends on revision datestamps maintaining
          a sequential orderingâthe younger the revision, the

      directories on our computers all the time.  And your version
      control system shouldn't get in the way of your doing these
      things with your version-controlled files and directories,
      either.  Subversion's file management support is quite
      liberating, affording almost as much flexibility for versioned
      files as you'd expect when manipulating your unversioned ones.
      But that flexibility means that across the lifetime of your
      repository, a given versioned object might have many paths, and
      a given path might represent several entirely different
      versioned objects.  This introduces a certain level of
      complexity to your interactions with those paths and
      objects.</p><p>Subversion is pretty smart about noticing when an object's
      version history includes such <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">changes of address.</span>â</span>
      For example, if you ask for the revision history log of a
      particular file that was renamed last week, Subversion happily
      provides all those logsâthe revision in which the rename
      itself happened, plus the logs of relevant revisions both before
      and after that rename.  So, most of the time, you don't even
      have to think about such things.  But occasionally, Subversion
      needs your help to clear up ambiguities.</p><p>The simplest example of this occurs when a directory or file
      is deleted from version control, and then a new directory or
      file is created with the same name and added to version control.
      The thing you deleted and the thing you later added aren't the
      same thing.  They merely happen to have had the same
      pathâ<code class="filename">/trunk/object</code>, for example.
      What, then, does it mean to ask Subversion about the history of
      <code class="filename">/trunk/object</code>?  Are you asking about the
      thing currently at that location, or the old thing you deleted
      from that location?  Are you asking about the operations that
      have happened to <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the objects that have
      ever lived at that path?  Subversion needs a hint about what you
      really want.</p><p>And thanks to moves, versioned object history can get far
      more twisted than even that.  For example, you might have a
      directory named <code class="filename">concept</code>, containing some
      nascent software project you've been toying with.  Eventually,
      though, that project matures to the point that the idea seems to
      actually have some wings, so you do the unthinkable and decide
      to give the project a name.<sup>[<a id="idp34283936" href="#ftn.idp34283936" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup>
      Let's say you called your software Frabnaggilywort.  At this
      point, it makes sense to rename the directory to reflect the
      project's new name, so <code class="filename">concept</code> is renamed
      to <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>.  Life goes on,
      Frabnaggilywort releases a 1.0 version and is downloaded and
      used daily by hordes of people aiming to improve their
      lives.</p><p>It's a nice story, really, but it doesn't end there.
      Entrepreneur that you are, you've already got another think in
      the tank.  So you make a new directory,
      <code class="filename">concept</code>, and the cycle begins again.  In
      fact, the cycle begins again many times over the years, each
      time starting with that old <code class="filename">concept</code>
      directory, then sometimes seeing that directory renamed as the
      idea cures, sometimes seeing it deleted when you scrap the idea.
      Or, to get really sick, maybe you rename
      <code class="filename">concept</code> to something else for a while, but
      later rename the thing back to <code class="filename">concept</code> for
      some reason.</p><p>In scenarios like these, attempting to instruct
      Subversion to work with these reused paths can be a little like
      instructing a motorist in Chicago's West Suburbs to drive east
      down Roosevelt Road and turn left onto Main Street.  In a mere
      20 minutes, you can cross <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Main Street</span>â</span> in
      Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, and Lombard.  And no, they aren't the same
      street.  Our motoristâand our Subversionâneed a
      little more detail to do the right thing.</p><p>Fortunately, Subversion allows you to tell it exactly which
      Main Street you meant.  The mechanism used is called a
      <em class="firstterm">peg revision</em>, and you provide these to
      Subversion for the sole purpose of identifying unique lines of
      history.  Because at most one versioned object may occupy a path
      at any given timeâor, more precisely, in any one
      revisionâthe combination of a path and a peg revision is
      all that is needed to unambiguously identify a specific line
      of history.  Peg revisions are specified to the Subversion
      command-line client using <em class="firstterm">at syntax</em>, so
      called because the syntax involves appending an <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">at
      sign</span>â</span> (<code class="literal">@</code>) and the peg revision to the
      end of the path with which the revision is associated.</p><p>But what of the <code class="option">--revision</code>
      (<code class="option">-r</code>) of which we've spoken so much in this
      book?  That revision (or set of revisions) is called the
      <em class="firstterm">operative revision</em> (or
      <em class="firstterm">operative revision range</em>).  Once a
      particular line of history has been identified using a path and
      peg revision, Subversion performs the requested operation using
      the operative revision(s).  To map this to our Chicagoland
      streets analogy, if we are told to go to 606 N. Main Street in
      Wheaton,<sup>[<a id="idp34297312" href="#ftn.idp34297312" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup> we can think
      of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Main Street</span>â</span> as our path and
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Wheaton</span>â</span> as our peg revision.  These two pieces of
      information identify a unique path that can be traveled (north or
      south on Main Street), and they keep us from traveling up and
      down the wrong Main Street in search of our destination.  Now we
      throw in <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">606 N.</span>â</span> as our operative revision of
      sorts, and we know <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> where to
      go.</p><div class="sidebar" title="The Peg Revision Algorithm"><a id="svn.advanced.pegrevs.algorithm"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>The Peg Revision Algorithm</strong></p></div></div></div><p>The Subversion command-line client performs the peg revision
        algorithm any time it needs to resolve possible ambiguities in
        the paths and revisions provided to it.  Here's an example of
        such an invocation:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn <em class="replaceable"><code>command</code></em> -r <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> item@<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>
</pre></div><p>If <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> is older than
        <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>, the algorithm is as
        follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Locate <em class="replaceable"><code>item</code></em> in the revision
            identified by <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>.  There
            can be only one such object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Trace the object's history backwards (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the revision
            <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Perform the requested action on that ancestor,
            wherever it is located, or whatever its name might
            be or might have been at that time.</p></li></ol></div><p>But what if <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>younger</em></span> than
        <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>?  Well, that adds some
        complexity to the theoretical problem of locating the path in
        <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>, because the path's
        history could have forked multiple times (thanks to copy
        operations) between <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em> and
        <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  And that's not
        allâSubversion doesn't store enough information to
        performantly trace an object's history forward, anyway.  So
        the algorithm is a little different:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Locate <em class="replaceable"><code>item</code></em> in the revision
            identified by <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  There
            can be only one such object.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Trace the object's history backward (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the revision
            <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Verify that the object's location (path-wise) in
            <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em> is the same as it is in
            <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  If that's the
            case, at least the two locations are known to be
            directly related, so perform the requested action on the
            location in <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.
            Otherwise, relatedness was not established, so error out
            with a loud complaint that no viable location was found.
            (Someday, we expect that Subversion will be able to handle
            this usage scenario with more flexibility and
            grace.)</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that even when you don't explicitly supply a peg
        revision or operative revision, they are still present.  For
        your convenience, the default peg revision is
        <code class="literal">BASE</code> for working copy items and
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> for repository URLs.  And when no
        operative revision is provided, it defaults to being the same
        revision as the peg revision.</p></div><p>Say that long ago we created our repository, and in revision 1
      we added our first <code class="filename">concept</code> directory, plus an
      <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file in that directory talking about
      the concept.  After several revisions in which real code was
      added and tweaked, we, in revision 20, renamed this directory to
      <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>.  By revision 27, we had a
      new concept, a new <code class="filename">concept</code> directory to
      hold it, and a new <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file to describe
      it.  And then five years and thousands of revisions flew by,
      just like they would in any good romance story.</p><p>Now, years later, we wonder what the
      <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file looked like back in revision 1.
      But Subversion needs to know whether we are asking about how the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>current</em></span> file looked back in revision 1, or
      whether we are asking for the contents of whatever file lived at
      <code class="filename">concept/IDEA</code> in revision 1.  Certainly
      those questions have different answers, and because of peg
      revisions, you can ask those questions.  To find out how the
      current <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file looked in that old
      revision, you run:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA 
svn: E195012: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</pre></div><p>Of course, in this example, the current
      <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file didn't exist yet in revision 1,
      so Subversion gives an error.  The previous command is shorthand
      for a longer notation which explicitly lists a peg revision.
      The expanded notation is:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA@BASE
svn: E195012: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</pre></div><p>And when executed, it has the expected results.</p><p>The perceptive reader is probably wondering at this point whether
      the peg revision syntax causes problems for working copy paths
      or URLs that actually have at signs in them.  After
      all, how does <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> know whether
      <code class="literal">news@11</code> is the name of a directory in my
      tree or just a syntax for <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revision 11 of
      <code class="filename">news</code></span>â</span>?  Thankfully, while
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> will always assume the latter, there is a
      trivial workaround.  You need only append an at sign to the
      end of the path, such as <code class="literal">news@11@</code>.
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> cares only about the last at sign in
      the argument, and it is not considered illegal to omit a literal
      peg revision specifier after that at sign.  This workaround
      even applies to paths that end in an at signâyou would
      use <code class="literal">filename@@</code> to talk about a file named
      <code class="filename">filename@</code>.</p><p>Let's ask the other question, thenâin revision 1, what
      were the contents of whatever file occupied the address
      <code class="filename">concepts/IDEA</code> at the time?  We'll use an
      explicit peg revision to help us out.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.
</pre></div><p>Notice that we didn't provide an operative revision this
      time.  That's because when no operative revision is specified,
      Subversion assumes a default operative revision that's the same
      as the peg revision.</p><p>As you can see, the output from our operation appears to be
      correct.  The text even mentions frabbing naggily worts, so this
      is almost certainly the file that describes the software now
      called Frabnaggilywort.  In fact, we can verify this using the
      combination of an explicit peg revision and explicit operative
      revision.  We know that in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>, the
      Frabnaggilywort project is located in the
      <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code> directory.  So we specify
      that we want to see how the line of history identified in

      situations.  But when you are, remember that peg revisions are
      that extra hint Subversion needs to clear up ambiguity.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.props"></a>Properties</h2></div></div></div><a id="idp34359648" class="indexterm"></a><p>We've already covered in detail how Subversion stores and
      retrieves various versions of files and directories in its
      repository.  Whole chapters have been devoted to this most
      fundamental piece of functionality provided by the tool.  And
      if the versioning support stopped there, Subversion would still
      be complete from a version control perspective.</p><p>But it doesn't stop there.</p><p>In addition to versioning your directories and files,
      Subversion provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and
      removing versioned metadata on each of your versioned
      directories and files.  We refer to this metadata as
      <em class="firstterm">properties</em>, and they can be thought of as
      two-column tables that map property names to arbitrary values
      attached to each item in your working copy.  Generally speaking,
      the names and values of the properties can be whatever you want
      them to be, with the constraint that the names must contain only
      ASCII characters.  And the best part about these properties is
      that they, too, are versioned, just like the textual contents of
      your files.  You can modify, commit, and revert property changes
      as easily as you can file content changes.  And the sending and
      receiving of property changes occurs as part of your typical
      commit and update operationsâyou don't have to change your
      basic processes to accommodate them.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Subversion has reserved the set of properties whose names
        begin with <code class="literal">svn:</code> as its own.  While there
        are only a handful of such properties in use today, you should
        avoid creating custom properties for your own needs whose names
        begin with this prefix.  Otherwise, you run the risk that a
        future release of Subversion will grow support for a feature
        or behavior driven by a property of the same name but with
        perhaps an entirely different interpretation.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too.  Just as
      files and directories may have arbitrary property names and
      values attached to them, each revision as a whole may have
      arbitrary properties attached to it.  The same constraints
      applyâhuman-readable names and anything-you-want binary
      values.  The main difference is that revision properties are not
      versioned.  In other words, if you change the value of, or
      delete, a revision property, there's no way, within the scope of
      Subversion's functionality, to recover the previous value.</p><p>Subversion has no particular policy regarding the use of
      properties.  It asks only that you do not use property names that
      begin with the prefix <code class="literal">svn:</code> as that's the
      namespace that it sets aside for its own use.  And Subversion
      does, in fact, use propertiesâboth the versioned and
      unversioned variety.  Certain versioned properties have special
      meaning or effects when found on files and directories, or they
      house a particular bit of information about the revisions on
      which they are found.  Certain revision properties are
      automatically attached to revisions by Subversion's commit
      process, and they carry information about the revision.  Most of
      these properties are mentioned elsewhere in this or other
      chapters as part of the more general topics to which they are
      related.  For an exhaustive list of Subversion's predefined
      properties, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.properties" title="Subversion Properties">the section called âSubversion Propertiesâ</a> in

        (<code class="literal">svn:date</code>, <code class="literal">svn:author</code>,
        <code class="literal">svn:log</code>, and so on) to revisions, it does
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> presume thereafter the existence of
        those properties, and neither should you or the tools you use to
        interact with your repository.  Revision properties can be
        deleted programmatically or via the client (if allowed by the
        repository hooks) without damaging Subversion's ability to
        function.  So, when writing scripts which operate on your
        Subversion repository data, do not make the mistake of
        assuming that any particular revision property exists on a
        revision.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>In this section, we will examine the utilityâboth to
      users of Subversion and to Subversion itselfâof property
      support.  You'll learn about the property-related
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands and how property
      modifications affect your normal Subversion workflow.</p><div class="sect2" title="Why Properties?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.props.why"></a>Why Properties?</h3></div></div></div><p>Just as Subversion uses properties to store extra
        information about the files, directories, and revisions that
        it contains, you might also find properties to be of similar
        use.  You might find it useful to have a place
        close to your versioned data to hang custom metadata about
        that data.</p><p>Say you wish to design a web site that houses many digital
        photos and displays them with captions and a datestamp.  Now,
        your set of photos is constantly changing, so you'd like to
        have as much of this site automated as possible.  These photos
        can be quite large, so as is common with sites of this nature,
        you want to provide smaller thumbnail images to your site
        visitors.</p><p>Now, you can get this functionality using traditional
        files.  That is, you can have your
        <code class="filename">image123.jpg</code> and an
        <code class="filename">image123-thumbnail.jpg</code> side by side in a
        directory.  Or if you want to keep the filenames the same, you
        might have your thumbnails in a different directory, such as
        <code class="filename">thumbnails/image123.jpg</code>.  You can also
        store your captions and datestamps in a similar fashion, again
        separated from the original image file.  But the problem here
        is that your collection of files multiplies with each new
        photo added to the site.</p><p>Now consider the same web site deployed in a way that
        makes use of Subversion's file properties.  Imagine having a
        single image file, <code class="filename">image123.jpg</code>, with
        properties set on that file that are named
        <code class="literal">caption</code>, <code class="literal">datestamp</code>, and
        even <code class="literal">thumbnail</code>.  Now your working copy
        directory looks much more manageableâin fact, it looks
        to the casual browser like there are nothing but image files
        in it.  But your automation scripts know better.  They know
        that they can use <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> (or better yet, they
        can use the Subversion language bindingsâsee <a class="xref" href="#svn.developer.usingapi" title="Using the APIs">the section called âUsing the APIsâ</a>) to dig out the extra
        information that your site needs to display without having to
        read an index file or play path manipulation games.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While Subversion places few restrictions on the names
          and values you use for properties, it has not been designed
          to optimally carry large property values or large sets of
          properties on a given file or directory.  Subversion
          commonly holds all the property names and values associated
          with a single item in memory at the same time, which can
          cause detrimental performance or failed operations when
          extremely large property sets are used.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Custom revision properties are also frequently used.  One
        common such use is a property whose value contains an issue
        tracker ID with which the revision is associated, perhaps
        because the change made in that revision fixes a bug filed in
        the tracker issue with that ID.  Other uses include hanging
        more friendly names on the revisionâit might be hard to
        remember that revision 1935 was a fully tested revision.  But
        if there's, say, a <code class="literal">test-results</code> property on
        that revision with the value <code class="literal">all passing</code>,
        that's meaningful information to have.  And Subversion allows
        you to easily do this via the <code class="option">--with-revprop</code>
        option of the <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          a major shortcoming: while it is a simple matter to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>set</em></span> a custom property,

          involves performing a linear walk across all the revisions

          have the property I'm looking for?</span>â</span>  Use
          the <code class="option">--with-all-revprops</code> option with

          facilitate this search.  Notice the presence of the custom
          revision property <code class="literal">testresults</code> in the
          following output:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Trying to find a custom versioned property is painful,
          too, and often involves a recursive <span class="command"><strong>svn
          propget</strong></span> across an entire working copy.  In your
          situation, that might not be as bad as a linear walk across
          all revisions.  But it certainly leaves much to be desired
          in terms of both performance and likelihood of success,
          especially if the scope of your search would require a
          working copy from the root of your repository.</p><p>For this reason, you might chooseâespecially in
          the revision property use caseâto simply add your
          metadata to the revision's log message using some
          policy-driven (and perhaps programmatically enforced)
          formatting that is designed to be quickly parsed from the
          output of <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>.  It is quite common to
          see the following in Subversion log messages:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
Issue(s): IZ2376, IZ1919
Reviewed by:  sally

This fixes a nasty segfault in the wort frabbing process
â¦
</pre></div><p>But here again lies some misfortune.  Subversion doesn't
          yet provide a log message templating mechanism, which would
          go a long way toward helping users be consistent with the
          formatting of their log-embedded revision metadata.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Manipulating Properties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.props.manip"></a>Manipulating Properties</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program affords a few ways to
        add or modify file and directory properties.  For properties
        with short, human-readable values, perhaps the simplest way to
        add a new property is to specify the property name and value
        on the command line of the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>
        subcommand:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/button.c
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre></div><p>But we've been touting the flexibility that Subversion
        offers for your property values.  And if you are planning to
        have a multiline textual, or even binary, property value, you
        probably do not want to supply that value on the command line.
        So the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> subcommand takes a
        <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) option for
        specifying the name of a file that contains the new property
        value.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset license -F /path/to/LICENSE calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre></div><p>There are some restrictions on the names you can use for
        properties.  A property name must start with a letter, a colon
        (<code class="literal">:</code>), or an underscore
        (<code class="literal">_</code>); after that, you can also use digits,
        hyphens (<code class="literal">-</code>), and periods
        (<code class="literal">.</code>).<sup>[<a id="idp34416672" href="#ftn.idp34416672" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup></p><p>In addition to the <span class="command"><strong>propset</strong></span> command, the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program supplies the
        <span class="command"><strong>propedit</strong></span> command.  This command uses the
        configured editor program (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="Config">the section called âConfigâ</a>) to add or
        modify properties.  When you run the command,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> invokes your editor program on a
        temporary file that contains the current value of the property
        (or that is empty, if you are adding a new property).  Then,
        you just modify that value in your editor program until it
        represents the new value you wish to store for the property,
        save the temporary file, and then exit the editor program.  If
        Subversion detects that you've actually changed the existing
        value of the property, it will accept that as the new property
        value.  If you exit your editor without making any changes, no
        property modification will occur:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propedit copyright calc/button.c  ### exit the editor without changes
No changes to property 'copyright' on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre></div><p>We should note that, as with other <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        subcommands, those related to properties can act on multiple
        paths at once.  This enables you to modify properties on whole
        sets of files with a single command.  For example, we could
        have done the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/*
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/Makefile'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/integer.c'
â¦
$
</pre></div><p>All of this property adding and editing isn't really very
        useful if you can't easily get the stored property value.  So
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program supplies two subcommands
        for displaying the names and values of properties stored on
        files and directories.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn proplist</strong></span>
        command will list the names of properties that exist on a
        path.  Once you know the names of the properties on the node,
        you can request their values individually using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        propget</strong></span>.  This command will, given a property name
        and a path (or set of paths), print the value of the property
        to the standard output stream.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        <span class="command"><strong>propdel</strong></span>.  Since Subversion allows you to

        property altogether using <span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span> or
        <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>.  For example, this command will
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> yield the desired effect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>You need to use the <span class="command"><strong>propdel</strong></span> subcommand
        to delete properties altogether.  The syntax is similar to the
        other property commands:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Remember those unversioned revision properties?  You can
        modify those, too, using the same <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        subcommands that we just described.  Simply add the
        <code class="option">--revprop</code> command-line parameter and specify
        the revision whose property you wish to modify.  Since
        revisions are global, you don't need to specify a target path
        to these property-related commands so long as you are
        positioned in a working copy of the repository whose revision
        property you wish to modify.  Otherwise, you can simply
        provide the URL of any path in the repository of interest
        (including the repository's root URL).  For example, you might
        want to replace the commit log message of an existing
        revision.<sup>[<a id="idp34443328" href="#ftn.idp34443328" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup>  If
        your current working directory is part of a working copy of
        your repository, you can simply run the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> command with no target path:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:log "* button.c: Fix a compiler warning." -r11 --revprop
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</pre></div><p>But even if you haven't checked out a working copy from
        that repository, you can still effect the property change by
        providing the repository's root URL:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:log "* button.c: Fix a compiler warning." -r11 --revprop \
              http://svn.example.com/repos/project
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</pre></div><p>Note that the ability to modify these unversioned
        properties must be explicitly added by the repository
        administrator (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.setlog" title="Commit Log Message Correction">the section called âCommit Log Message Correctionâ</a>).
        That's because the properties aren't versioned, so you run the risk of
        losing information if you aren't careful with your edits.
        The repository administrator can set up methods to protect
        against this loss, and by default, modification of
        unversioned properties is disabled.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Users should, where possible, use <span class="command"><strong>svn

        revert</strong></span> command will restore your files and
        directories to their unedited statesâcontents, properties,
        and all.  Also, you can receive interesting information about
        the state of your file and directory properties by using the

        program will ignore property patchesâas a rule, it
        ignores any noise it can't understand.  This does,
        unfortunately, mean that to fully apply a patch generated by
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> using <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span>,
        any property modifications will need to be applied by
        hand.</p><p>Subversion 1.7 improves this situation in two ways.
        First, its nonstandard display of property differences is at
        least machine-readableâan improvement over the display
        of properties in versions prior to 1.7.  But Subversion 1.7
        also introduces the <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span> subcommand,
        designed specifically to handle the additional information
        which <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>'s output can carry, applying
        those changes to the Subversion working copy.  Of specific
        relevance to our topic, property differences present in patch
        files generated by <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> in Subversion
        1.7 or better can be automatically applied to a working copy
        by the <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span> command.  For more
        about <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span>, see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svn.c.patch" title="svn patch">svn patch</a> in

          serves to cause patching programs (including <span class="command"><strong>svn

          This might sound like a bug, but it really isn't because
          this property is intended to be managed solely by
          the <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> subcommand.  For more about

        key components of many Subversion features discussed elsewhere
        in this and other chaptersâtextual diff and merge
        support, keyword substitution, newline translation, and so on.  But
        to get the full benefit of properties, they must be set on the
        right files and directories.  Unfortunately, that
        step can be easily forgotten in the routine of things, especially
        since failing to set a property doesn't usually result in an
        obvious error (at least compared to, say, failing to
        add a file to version control).  To help your properties get
        applied to the places that need them, Subversion provides a
        couple of simple but useful features.</p><p>Whenever you introduce a file to version control using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span>
        commands, Subversion tries to assist by setting some common
        file properties automatically.  First, on operating systems
        whose filesystems support an execute permission bit,
        Subversion will automatically set the
        <code class="literal">svn:executable</code> property on newly added or
        imported files whose execute bit is enabled.  (See <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.executable" title="File Executability">the section called âFile Executabilityâ</a> later in
        this chapter for more about this property.)</p><p>Second, Subversion tries to determine the file's MIME
        type.  If you've configured a
        <code class="literal">mime-types-files</code> runtime configuration
        parameter, Subversion will try to find a MIME type mapping in
        that file for your file's extension.  If it finds such a
        mapping, it will set your file's
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to the MIME type it
        found.  If no mapping file is configured, or no mapping for
        your file's extension could be found, Subversion will fall
        back to heuristic algorithms to determine the file's MIME
        type.  Depending on how it is built, Subversion 1.7 can make
        use of file scanning libraries<sup>[<a id="idp34498624" href="#ftn.idp34498624" class="footnote">15</a>]</sup> to detect a file's type based on its
        content.  Failing all else, Subversion will employ its own
        very basic heuristic to determine whether the file contains
        nontextual content.  If so, it automatically sets the
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on that file to
        <code class="literal">application/octet-stream</code> (the generic
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">this is a collection of bytes</span>â</span> MIME type).  Of
        course, if Subversion guesses incorrectly, or if you wish to
        set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to something
        more preciseâperhaps <code class="literal">image/png</code> or
        <code class="literal">application/x-shockwave-flash</code>âyou can
        always remove or edit that property.  (For more on
        Subversion's use of MIME types, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called âFile Content Typeâ</a> later in
        this chapter.)</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>UTF-16 is commonly used to encode files whose semantic
          content is textual in nature, but the encoding itself makes
          heavy use of bytes which are outside the typical ASCII
          character byte range.  As such, Subversion will tend to
          classify such files as binary files, much to the chagrin of
          users who desire line-based differencing and merging,
          keyword substitution, and other behaviors for those
          files.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Subversion also provides, via its runtime configuration
        system (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ</a>), a more
        flexible automatic property setting feature that allows you
        to create mappings of filename patterns to property names and
        values.  Once again, these mappings affect adds and imports,
        and can not only override the default MIME type decision made
        by Subversion during those operations, but can also set
        additional Subversion or custom properties, too.  For example,
        you might create a mapping that says that anytime you add
        JPEG filesâones whose names match the pattern
        <code class="literal">*.jpg</code>âSubversion should automatically
        set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on those
        files to <code class="literal">image/jpeg</code>.  Or perhaps any files
        that match <code class="literal">*.cpp</code> should have
        <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> set to
        <code class="literal">native</code>, and <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code>
        set to <code class="literal">Id</code>.  Automatic property support is
        perhaps the handiest property-related tool in the Subversion
        toolbox.  See <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="Config">the section called âConfigâ</a> for more about
        configuring that support.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Subversion administrators commonly ask if it is possible

          that server.  Unfortunately, Subversion doesn't offer this
          feature.  Administrators can use hook scripts to validate
          that the properties added to and modified on files and
          directories match the administrator's preferred policies,
          rejecting commits which are non-compliant in this fashion.

      themselves on different computers with different operating
      systems, Subversion's command-line program behaves almost
      identically on all those systems.  If you know how to wield
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> on one platform, you know how to wield it
      everywhere.</p><p>However, the same is not always true of other general classes
      of software or of the actual files you keep in Subversion.  For
      example, on a Windows machine, the definition of a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">text
      file</span>â</span> would be similar to that used on a Linux box, but
      with a key differenceâthe character sequences used to mark
      the ends of the lines of those files.  There are other
      differences, too.  Unix platforms have (and Subversion supports)
      symbolic links; Windows does not.  Unix platforms use filesystem
      permission to determine executability; Windows uses filename
      extensions.</p><p>Because Subversion is in no position to unite the whole
      world in common definitions and implementations of all of these
      things, the best it can do is to try to help make your life
      simpler when you need to work with your versioned files and
      directories on multiple computers and operating systems.  This
      section describes some of the ways Subversion does this.</p><div class="sect2" title="File Content Type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"></a>File Content Type</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion joins the ranks of the many applications that
        recognize and make use of Multipurpose Internet Mail
        Extensions (MIME) content types.  Besides being a
        general-purpose storage location for a file's content type,
        the value of the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> file
        property determines some behavioral characteristics of
        Subversion itself.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Identifying File Types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Identifying File Types</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Various programs on most modern operating systems make
          assumptions about the type and format of the contents of a
          file by the file's name, specifically its file extension.
          For example, files whose names end in
          <code class="filename">.txt</code> are generally assumed to be
          human-readable; that is, able to be understood by simple perusal
          rather than requiring complex processing to decipher.  Files
          whose names end in <code class="filename">.png</code>, on the other
          hand, are assumed to be of the Portable Network Graphics
          typeânot human-readable at all, and sensible only when
          interpreted by software that understands the PNG format and
          can render the information in that format as a raster
          image.</p><p>Unfortunately, some of those extensions have changed
          their meanings over time.  When personal computers first appeared,
          a file named <code class="filename">README.DOC</code> would have
          almost certainly been a plain-text file, just like today's
          <code class="filename">.txt</code> files.  But by the mid-1990s, you
          could almost bet that a file of that name would not be a
          plain-text file at all, but instead a Microsoft Word
          document in a proprietary, non-human-readable format.  But
          this change didn't occur overnightâthere was certainly
          a period of confusion for computer users over what exactly
          they had in hand when they saw a <code class="filename">.DOC</code>
          file.<sup>[<a id="idp34532352" href="#ftn.idp34532352" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup></p><p>The popularity of computer networking cast still more
          doubt on the mapping between a file's name and its content.
          With information being served across networks and generated
          dynamically by server-side scripts, there was often no real
          file per se, and therefore no filename.  Web
          servers, for example, needed some other way to tell browsers
          what they were downloading so that the browser could do something
          intelligent with that information, whether that was to
          display the data using a program registered to handle that
          datatype or to prompt the user for where on the client
          machine to store the downloaded data.</p><p>Eventually, a standard emerged for, among other things,
          describing the contents of a data stream.  In 1996, RFC 2045
          was published.  It was the first of five RFCs describing
          MIME.  It describes the concept of media types and subtypes
          and recommends a syntax for the representation of those
          types.  Today, MIME media typesâor <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">MIME
          types</span>â</span>âare used almost universally across
          email applications, web servers, and other software as the
          de facto mechanism for clearing up the file content
          confusion.</p></div><p>For example, one of the benefits that Subversion typically
        provides is contextual, line-based merging of changes received
        from the server during an update into your working file.  But
        for files containing nontextual data, there is often no
        concept of a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">line.</span>â</span>  So, for versioned files
        whose <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is set to a
        nontextual MIME type (generally, something that doesn't begin
        with <code class="literal">text/</code>, though there are exceptions),
        Subversion does not attempt to perform contextual merges
        during updates.  Instead, any time you have locally modified a
        binary working copy file that is also being updated, your file
        is left untouched and Subversion creates two new files.  One
        file has a <code class="filename">.oldrev</code> extension and contains
        the BASE revision of the file.  The other file has a
        <code class="filename">.newrev</code> extension and contains the
        contents of the updated revision of the file.  This behavior
        is really for the protection of the user against failed
        attempts at performing contextual merges on files that simply
        cannot be contextually merged.</p><p>Additionally, since the acts of displaying line-based
        differences and line-based change attribution are, rather
        obviously, dependent on there being a meaningful definition
        of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">line</span>â</span> for a given file, files with nontextual
        MIME types will by default trigger errors when used as the
        targets of <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        annotate</strong></span> operations.  This can be especially
        frustrating for users with XML files whose
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is set to something
        such as <code class="literal">application/xml</code> which is not
        unambiguously human-readable and as such is treated as
        nontextual by Subversion.  Fortunately, those subcommands
        offer a <code class="option">--force</code> option for forcing
        Subversion to attempt the operations in spite of the apparent
        non-human-readability of the files.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property, when set
          to a value that does not indicate textual file contents, can
          cause some unexpected behaviors with respect to other
          properties.  For example, since the idea of line endings
          (and therefore, line-ending conversion) makes no sense when
          applied to nontextual files, Subversion will prevent you
          from setting the <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property
          on such files.  This is obvious when attempted on a single
          file targetâ<span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> will error
          out.  But it might not be as clear if you perform a
          recursive property set, where Subversion will silently skip
          over files that it deems unsuitable for a given
          property.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Subversion provides a number of mechanisms by which to
        automatically set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
        property on a versioned file.  See
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.auto" title="Automatic Property Setting">the section called âAutomatic Property Settingâ</a> for details.</p><p>Also, if the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is
        set, then the Subversion Apache module will use its value to
        populate the <code class="literal">Content-type:</code> HTTP header when
        responding to GET requests.  This gives your web browser a
        crucial clue about how to display a file when you use it to
        peruse your Subversion repository's contents.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="File Executability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.props.special.executable"></a>File Executability</h3></div></div></div><p>On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file
        as a command is governed by the presence of an execute
        permission bit.  This bit usually defaults to being disabled,
        and must be explicitly enabled by the user for each file that
        needs it.  But it would be a monumental hassle to have to
        remember exactly which files in a freshly checked-out working
        copy were supposed to have their executable bits toggled on,
        and then to have to do that toggling.  So, Subversion provides
        the <code class="literal">svn:executable</code> property as a way to
        specify that the executable bit for the file on which that
        property is set should be enabled, and Subversion honors that
        request when populating working copies with such files.</p><p>This property has no effect on filesystems that have no
        concept of an executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and
        NTFS.<sup>[<a id="idp34164192" href="#ftn.idp34164192" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup>  Also, although it has no defined
        values, Subversion will force its value
        to <code class="literal">*</code> when setting this property.  Finally,
        this property is valid only on files, not on
        directories.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="End-of-Line Character Sequences"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style"></a>End-of-Line Character Sequences</h3></div></div></div><p>Unless otherwise noted using a versioned file's
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property, Subversion
        assumes the file contains human-readable data.  Generally
        speaking, Subversion uses this knowledge only to determine
        whether contextual difference reports for that file are
        possible.  Otherwise, to Subversion, bytes are bytes.</p><p>This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any
        attention to the type of <em class="firstterm">end-of-line (EOL)
        markers</em> used in your files.  Unfortunately,
        different operating systems have different conventions about
        which character sequences represent the end of a line of text
        in a file.  For example, the usual line-ending token used by
        software on the Windows platform is a pair of ASCII control
        charactersâa carriage return (<code class="literal">CR</code>)
        followed by a line feed (<code class="literal">LF</code>).  Unix
        software, however, just uses the <code class="literal">LF</code>
        character to denote the end of a line.</p><p>Not all of the various tools on these operating systems
        understand files that contain line endings in a format that
        differs from the <em class="firstterm">native line-ending
        style</em> of the operating system on which they are
        running.  So, typically, Unix programs treat the
        <code class="literal">CR</code> character present in Windows files as a
        regular character (usually rendered as <code class="literal">^M</code>),
        and Windows programs combine all of the lines of a Unix file
        into one giant line because no carriage return-linefeed (or
        <code class="literal">CRLF</code>) character combination was found to
        denote the ends of the lines.</p><p>This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can be
        frustrating for folks who share a file across different
        operating systems.  For example, consider a source code
        file, and developers who edit this file on both Windows and
        Unix systems.  If all the developers always use tools that
        preserve the line-ending style of the file, no problems
        occur.</p><p>But in practice, many common tools either fail to
        properly read a file with foreign EOL markers, or
        convert the file's line endings to the native style when the
        file is saved.  If the former is true for a developer, he
        has to use an external conversion utility (such as
        <span class="command"><strong>dos2unix</strong></span> or its companion,
        <span class="command"><strong>unix2dos</strong></span>) to prepare the file for
        editing.  The latter case requires no extra preparation.
        But both cases result in a file that differs from the
        original quite literally on every line!  Prior to committing
        his changes, the user has two choices.  Either he can use a
        conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
        line-ending style that it was in before his edits were made,
        or he can simply commit the fileânew EOL markers and
        all.</p><p>The result of scenarios like these include wasted time
        and unnecessary modifications to committed files.  Wasted
        time is painful enough.  But when commits change every line
        in a file, this complicates the job of determining which of
        those lines were changed in a nontrivial way.  Where was
        that bug really fixed?  On what line was a syntax error
        introduced?</p><p>The solution to this problem is the
        <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property.  When this
        property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to
        determine what special processing to perform on the file so
        that the file's line-ending style isn't flip-flopping with
        every commit that comes from a different operating
        system.  The valid values are:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">native</code></span></dt><dd><p>This causes the file to contain the EOL markers
              that are native to the operating system on which
              Subversion was run.  In other words, if a user on a
              Windows machine checks out a working copy that
              contains a file with an
              <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property set to
              <code class="literal">native</code>, that file will contain
              <code class="literal">CRLF</code> EOL markers.  A Unix user
              checking out a working copy that contains the same
              file will see <code class="literal">LF</code> EOL markers in his
              copy of the file.</p><p>Note that Subversion will actually store the file
              in the repository using normalized
              <code class="literal">LF</code> EOL markers regardless of the
              operating system.  This is basically transparent to
              the user, though.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">CRLF</code></span></dt><dd><p>This causes the file to contain

      alongside all those versioned files and directories are other
      files and directories that are neither versioned nor intended
      to be.  Text editors litter directories with backup files.
      Software compilers generate intermediateâor even
      finalâfiles that you typically wouldn't bother to
      version.  And users themselves drop various other files and
      directories wherever they see fit, often in version control
      working copies.</p><p>It's ludicrous to expect Subversion working copies to be
      somehow impervious to this kind of clutter and impurity.  In
      fact, Subversion counts it as a <span class="emphasis"><em>feature</em></span>
      that its working copies are just typical directories, just like
      unversioned trees.  But these not-to-be-versioned files and
      directories can cause some annoyance for Subversion users.  For
      example, because the <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      import</strong></span> commands act recursively by default and don't
      know which files in a given tree you do and don't wish to
      version, it's easy to accidentally add stuff to version control
      that you didn't mean to.  And because <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span> reports, by default, every item of interest in
      a working copyâincluding unversioned files and
      directoriesâits output can get quite noisy where many of
      these things exist.</p><p>So Subversion provides two ways for telling it which files
      you would prefer that it simply disregard.  One of the ways
      involves the use of Subversion's runtime configuration system
      (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ</a>), and therefore
      applies to all the Subversion operations that make use of that
      runtime configurationâgenerally those performed on a particular
      computer or by a particular user of a computer.  The other way
      makes use of Subversion's directory property support and is more
      tightly bound to the versioned tree itself, and therefore
      affects everyone who has a working copy of that tree.  Both of
      the mechanisms use <em class="firstterm">file patterns</em> (strings
      of literal and special wildcard characters used to match against
      filenames) to decide which files to ignore.</p><p>The Subversion runtime configuration system provides an
      option, <code class="literal">global-ignores</code>, whose value is a
      whitespace-delimited collection of file patterns.  The
      Subversion client checks these patterns against the names of the
      files that are candidates for addition to version control, as
      well as to unversioned files that the <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span> command notices.  If any file's name matches
      one of the patterns, Subversion will basically act as if the
      file didn't exist at all.  This is really useful for the kinds
      of files that you almost never want to version, such as editor
      backup files such as Emacs' <code class="literal">*~</code> and
      <code class="literal">.*~</code> files.</p><div class="sidebar" title="File Patterns in Subversion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>File Patterns in Subversion</strong></p></div></div></div><p>File patterns (also called <em class="firstterm">globs</em> or
        <em class="firstterm">shell wildcard patterns</em>) are strings of
        characters that are intended to be matched against filenames,
        typically for the purpose of quickly selecting some subset of
        similar files from a larger grouping without having to
        explicitly name each file.  The patterns contain two types of
        characters:  regular characters, which are compared explicitly
        against potential matches, and special wildcard characters,
        which are interpreted differently for matching
        purposes.</p><p>There are different types of file pattern syntaxes, but
        Subversion uses the one most commonly found in Unix systems
        implemented as the <code class="function">fnmatch</code> system
        function.  It supports the following wildcards, described here
        simply for your convenience:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">?</code></span></dt><dd><p>Matches any single character</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">*</code></span></dt><dd><p>Matches any string of characters, including the
              empty string</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">[</code></span></dt><dd><p>Begins a character class definition terminated by
              <code class="literal">]</code>, used for matching a subset of
              characters</p></dd></dl></div><p>You can see this same pattern matching behavior at a Unix
        shell prompt.  The following are some examples of patterns
        being used for various things:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        we've described here, but this basic usage level tends to suit
        the majority of Subversion users.</p></div><p>When found on a versioned directory, the
      <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is expected to contain a
      list of newline-delimited file patterns that Subversion should
      use to determine ignorable objects in that same directory.
      These patterns do not override those found in the
      <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> runtime configuration option,
      but are instead appended to that list.  And it's worth noting
      again that, unlike the <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> option,
      the patterns found in the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code>
      property apply only to the directory on which that property is
      set, and not to any of its subdirectories.  The
      <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property is a good way to tell
      Subversion to ignore files that are likely to be present in
      every user's working copy of that directory, such as compiler
      output orâto use an example more appropriate to this
      bookâthe HTML, PDF, or PostScript files generated as the

        the ignore patterns at some different times, and there are

      on the <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> property and its

      that source code file <code class="filename">data.c</code> that you
      probably forgot to add to version control.</p><p>Of course, this less-verbose report of your working copy
      status isn't the only one available.  If you actually want to
      see the ignored files as part of the status report, you can pass
      the <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option to Subversion:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M      calc
 M      calc/button.c
I       calc/calculator

I       calc/debug_log.2.gz
I       calc/debug_log.3.gz
</pre></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the list of file patterns to ignore is
      also used by <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      import</strong></span>.  Both of these operations involve asking
      Subversion to begin managing some set of files and directories.
      Rather than force the user to pick and choose which files in a
      tree she wishes to start versioning, Subversion uses the ignore
      patternsâboth the global and the per-directory
      listsâto determine which files should not be swept into
      the version control system as part of a larger recursive
      addition or import operation.  And here again, you can use the
      <code class="option">--no-ignore</code> option to tell Subversion to disregard
      its ignores list and operate on all the files and directories
      present.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Even if <code class="literal">svn:ignore</code> is set, you may run
        into problems if you use shell wildcards in a command.  Shell

      <em class="firstterm">keywords</em>âpieces of useful,
      dynamic information about a versioned fileâinto the
      contents of the file itself.  Keywords generally provide
      information about the last modification made to the file.
      Because this information changes each time the
      file changes, and more importantly, just
      <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the file changes, it is a hassle
      for any process except the version control system to keep
      the data completely up to date.  Left to human authors, the
      information would inevitably grow stale.</p><p>For example, say you have a document in which you would
      like to display the last date on which it was modified.  You
      could burden every author of that document to, just before
      committing their changes, also tweak the part of the
      document that describes when it was last changed.  But
      sooner or later, someone would forget to do that.  Instead,
      simply ask Subversion to perform keyword substitution on the
      <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code> keyword.  You control
      where the keyword is inserted into your document by placing
      a <em class="firstterm">keyword anchor</em> at the desired
      location in the file.  This anchor is just a string of text
      formatted as
      <code class="literal">$</code><em class="replaceable"><code>KeywordName</code></em><code class="literal">$</code>.</p><p>All keywords are case-sensitive where they appear as
      anchors in files: you must use the correct capitalization
      for the keyword to be expanded.  You should consider the
      value of the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property to be
      case-sensitive, tooâcertain keyword names will be recognized
      regardless of case, but this behavior is deprecated.</p><p>Subversion defines the list of keywords available for
      substitution.  That list contains the following keywords, 
      some of which have aliases that you can also use:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Date</code></span></dt><dd><p>This keyword describes the last time the file was
            known to have been changed in the repository, and is of

            22 Jul 2006) $</code>.  It may also be specified as
            <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code>.  Unlike the
            <code class="literal">Id</code> keyword, which uses UTC, the
            <code class="literal">Date</code> keyword displays dates using the
            local time zone.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Revision</code></span></dt><dd><p>This keyword describes the last known revision in
            which this file changed in the repository, and looks

            It may also be specified as

            <code class="literal">Rev</code>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Author</code></span></dt><dd><p>This keyword describes the last known user to

      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">last known</span>â</span> or similar wording.  Keep in mind that
      keyword expansion is a client-side operation, and your client
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">knows</span>â</span> only about changes that have occurred in
      the repository when you update your working copy to include
      those changes.  If you never update your working copy, your
      keywords will never expand to different values even if those
      versioned files are being changed regularly in the
      repository.</p><p>Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does nothing
      special.  Subversion will never attempt to perform textual
      substitutions on your file contents unless explicitly asked to
      do so.  After all, you might be writing a
      document<sup>[<a id="idp34713040" href="#ftn.idp34713040" class="footnote">19</a>]</sup> about how to use keywords, and
      you don't want Subversion to substitute your beautiful examples
      of unsubstituted keyword anchors!</p><p>To tell Subversion whether to substitute keywords
      on a particular file, we again turn to the property-related
      subcommands.  The <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property,
      when set on a versioned file, controls which keywords will
      be substituted on that file.  The value is a space-delimited
      list of keyword names or aliases.</p><p>For example, say you have a versioned file named
      <code class="filename">weather.txt</code> that looks like
      this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate$
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</pre></div><p>With no <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property set on
      that file, Subversion will do nothing special.  Now, let's
      enable substitution of the
      <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code> keyword.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author" weather.txt
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$
</pre></div><p>Now you have made a local property modification on the
      <code class="filename">weather.txt</code> file.  You will see no
      changes to the file's contents (unless you made some of your
      own prior to setting the property).  Notice that the file
      contained a keyword anchor for the <code class="literal">Rev</code>
      keyword, yet we did not include that keyword in the property
      value we set.  Subversion will happily ignore requests to
      substitute keywords that are not present in the file and
      will not substitute keywords that are not present in the
      <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property value.</p><p>Immediately after you commit this property change,
      Subversion will update your working file with the new
      substitute text.  Instead of seeing your keyword anchor
      <code class="literal">$LastChangedDate$</code>, you'll see its
      substituted result.  That result also contains the name of
      the keyword and continues to be delimited by the dollar sign
      (<code class="literal">$</code>) characters.  And as we predicted, the
      <code class="literal">Rev</code> keyword was not substituted because
      we didn't ask for it to be.</p><p>Note also that we set the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code>
      property to <code class="literal">Date Author</code>, yet the keyword
      anchor used the alias <code class="literal">$LastChangedDate$</code>
      and still expanded correctly:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</pre></div><p>If someone else now commits a change to
      <code class="filename">weather.txt</code>, your copy of that file
      will continue to display the same substituted keyword value
      as beforeâuntil you update your working copy.  At that
      time, the keywords in your <code class="filename">weather.txt</code>
      file will be resubstituted with information that
      reflects the most recent known commit to that file.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Where's $GlobalRev$?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Where's $GlobalRev$?</strong></p></div></div></div><p>New users are often confused by how the
        <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> keyword works.  Since the repository
        has a single, globally increasing revision number, many people
        assume that it is this number that is reflected by the
        <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> keyword's value.  But
        <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> expands to show the last revision in
        which the file <span class="emphasis"><em>changed</em></span>, not the last
        revision to which it was updated.  Understanding this clears
        the confusion, but frustration often remainsâwithout the
        support of a Subversion keyword to do so, how can you
        automatically get the global revision number into your
        files?</p><p>To do this, you need external processing.  Subversion
        ships with a tool called <span class="command"><strong>svnversion</strong></span>, which
        was designed for just this purpose.  It crawls your working
        copy and generates as output the revision(s) it finds.  You
        can use this program, plus some additional tooling, to embed
        that revision information into your files.  For more
        information on <span class="command"><strong>svnversion</strong></span>, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svnversion" title="svnversionâSubversion Working Copy Version Info">the section called âsvnversionâSubversion Working Copy Version Infoâ</a> in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.</p></div><p>You can also instruct Subversion to maintain a fixed length
      (in terms of the number of bytes consumed) for the substituted
      keyword.  By using a double colon (<code class="literal">::</code>) after
      the keyword name, followed by a number of space characters, you
      define that fixed width.  When Subversion goes to substitute
      your keyword for the keyword and its value, it will essentially
      replace only those space characters, leaving the overall width
      of the keyword field unchanged.  If the substituted value is
      shorter than the defined field width, there will be extra
      padding characters (spaces) at the end of the substituted field;
      if it is too long, it is truncated with a special hash
      (<code class="literal">#</code>) character just before the final dollar
      sign terminator.</p><p>For example, say you have a document in which you have
      some section of tabular data reflecting the document's
      Subversion keywords.  Using the original Subversion keyword
      substitution syntax, your file might look something
      like:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
$Rev$:     Revision of last commit
$Author$:  Author of last commit
$Date$:    Date of last commit
</pre></div><p>Now, that looks nice and tabular at the start of things.
      But when you then commit that file (with keyword substitution
      enabled, of course), you see:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
$Rev: 12 $:     Revision of last commit
$Author: harry $:  Author of last commit
$Date: 2006-03-15 02:33:03 -0500 (Wed, 15 Mar 2006) $:    Date of last commit
</pre></div><p>The result is not so beautiful.  And you might be
      tempted to then adjust the file after the substitution so
      that it again looks tabular.  But that holds only as long as
      the keyword values are the same width.  If the last
      committed revision rolls into a new place value (say, from
      99 to 100), or if another person with a longer username
      commits the file, stuff gets all crooked again.  However, if
      you are using Subversion 1.2 or later, you can use the new
      fixed-length keyword syntax and define some field widths that
      seem sane, so your file might look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
$Rev::               $:  Revision of last commit
$Author::            $:  Author of last commit
$Date::              $:  Date of last commit
</pre></div><p>You commit this change to your file.  This time,
      Subversion notices the new fixed-length keyword syntax and
      maintains the width of the fields as defined by the padding
      you placed between the double colon and the trailing dollar
      sign.  After substitution, the width of the fields is
      completely unchangedâthe short values for
      <code class="literal">Rev</code> and <code class="literal">Author</code> are
      padded with spaces, and the long <code class="literal">Date</code>
      field is truncated by a hash character:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
$Rev:: 13            $:  Revision of last commit
$Author:: harry      $:  Author of last commit
$Date:: 2006-03-15 0#$:  Date of last commit
</pre></div><p>The use of fixed-length keywords is especially handy when
      performing substitutions into complex file formats that
      themselves use fixed-length fields for data, or for which the
      stored size of a given data field is overbearingly difficult to
      modify from outside the format's native application.  Of course,
      where binary file formats are concerned, you must always take great
      care that any keyword substitution you introduceâfixed-length
      or otherwiseâdoes not violate the integrity of that format.
      While it might sound easy enough, this can be an astonishingly
      difficult task for most of the popular binary file formats in use
      today, and <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> something to be undertaken by
      the faint of heart!</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Be aware that because the width of a keyword field is
        measured in bytes, the potential for corruption of
        multibyte values exists.  For example, a username that
        contains some multibyte UTF-8 characters might suffer
        truncation in the middle of the string of bytes that make
        up one of those characters.  The result will be a mere
        truncation when viewed at the byte level, but will likely
        appear as a string with an incorrect or garbled final
        character when viewed as UTF-8 text.  It is conceivable
        that certain applications, when asked to load the file,
        would notice the broken UTF-8 text and deem the entire
        file corrupt, refusing to operate on the file
        altogether.  So, when limiting keywords to a fixed size,
        choose a size that allows for this type of byte-wise
        expansion.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Sparse Directories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.sparsedirs"></a>Sparse Directories</h2></div></div></div><p>By default, most Subversion operations on directories act in
      a recursive manner.  For example, <span class="command"><strong>svn
      checkout</strong></span> creates a working copy with every file and
      directory in the specified area of the repository, descending
      recursively through the repository tree until the entire
      structure is copied to your local disk.  Subversion 1.5
      introduces a feature called <em class="firstterm">sparse
      directories</em> (or <em class="firstterm">shallow
      checkouts</em>) that allows you to easily check out a
      working copyâor a portion of a working copyâmore
      shallowly than full recursion, with the freedom to bring in
      previously ignored files and subdirectories at a later
      time.</p><p>For example, say we have a repository with a tree of files
      and directories with names of the members of a human family with
      pets.  (It's an odd example, to be sure, but bear with us.)  A
      regular <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> operation will give us a
      working copy of the whole tree:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom
A    mom/son
A    mom/son/grandson
A    mom/daughter
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny1.txt
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny2.txt
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter2
A    mom/daughter/fishie.txt
A    mom/kitty1.txt
A    mom/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$
</pre></div><p>Now, let's check out the same tree again, but this time
      we'll ask Subversion to give us only the topmost directory
      with none of its children at all:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-empty --depth empty
Checked out revision 1
$
</pre></div><p>Notice that we added to our original <span class="command"><strong>svn
      checkout</strong></span> command line a new <code class="option">--depth</code>
      option.  This option is present on many of Subversion's
      subcommands and is similar to the
      <code class="option">--non-recursive</code> (<code class="option">-N</code>) and
      <code class="option">--recursive</code> (<code class="option">-R</code>) options.  In
      fact, it combines, improves upon, supercedes, and ultimately
      obsoletes these two older options.  For starters, it expands the
      supported degrees of depth specification available to users,
      adding some previously unsupported (or inconsistently supported)
      depths.  Here are the depth values that you can request for a
      given Subversion operation:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">--depth empty</code></span></dt><dd><p>Include only the immediate target of the operation,
            not any of its file or directory children.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">--depth files</code></span></dt><dd><p>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file children.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">--depth immediates</code></span></dt><dd><p>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file or directory children.  The directory

            children, its children's children, and so on to full
            recursion.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Of course, merely combining two existing options into one
      hardly constitutes a new feature worthy of a whole section in
      our book.  Fortunately, there is more to this story.  This idea
      of depth extends not just to the operations you perform with
      your Subversion client, but also as a description of a working
      copy citizen's <em class="firstterm">ambient depth</em>, which is
      the depth persistently recorded by the working copy for that
      item.  Its key strength is this very persistenceâthe fact
      that it is <em class="firstterm">sticky</em>.  The working copy
      remembers the depth you've selected for each item in it until
      you later change that depth selection; by default, Subversion
      commands operate on the working copy citizens present,

      only the target, but something less than full recursion.</p><p>We've used <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> as an example
      here, but you'll find the <code class="option">--depth</code> option
      present on many other Subversion commands, too.  In those other
      commands, depth specification is a way to limit the scope of an
      operation to some depth, much like the way the older
      <code class="option">--non-recursive</code> (<code class="option">-N</code>) and
      <code class="option">--recursive</code> (<code class="option">-R</code>) options
      behave.  This means that when operating on a working copy of
      some depth, while requesting an operation of a shallower depth,
      the operation is limited to that shallower depth.  In fact, we
      can make an even more general statement: given a working copy of
      any arbitraryâeven mixedâambient depth, and a
      Subversion command with some requested operational depth, the
      command will maintain the ambient depth of the working copy
      members while still limiting the scope of the operation to the
      requested (or default) operational depth.</p><p>In addition to the <code class="option">--depth</code> option, the
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>
      subcommands also accept a second depth-related option:
      <code class="option">--set-depth</code>.  It is with this option that you
      can change the sticky depth of a working copy item.  Watch what

</pre></div><p>Fortunately, having a complex collection of ambient depths
      in a single working copy doesn't complicate the way you interact
      with that working copy.  You can still make, revert, display,
      and commit local modifications in your working copy without
      providing any new options (including <code class="option">--depth</code> and
      <code class="option">--set-depth</code>) to the relevant subcommands.  Even
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> works as it does elsewhere when no
      specific depth is providedâit updates the working copy
      targets that are present while honoring their sticky
      depths.</p><p>You might at this point be wondering, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">So what?  When
      would I use this?</span>â</span>  One scenario where this feature
      finds utility is tied to a particular repository layout,
      specifically where you have many related or codependent
      projects or software modules living as siblings in a single
      repository location (<code class="filename">trunk/project1</code>,
      <code class="filename">trunk/project2</code>,
      <code class="filename">trunk/project3</code>, etc.).  In such
      scenarios, it might be the case that you personally care 
      about only a handful of those projectsâmaybe some primary
      project and a few other modules on which it depends.  You can
      check out individual working copies of all of these things, but
      those working copies are disjoint and, as a result, it can be
      cumbersome to perform operations across several or all of them
      at the same time.  The alternative is to use the sparse
      directories feature, building out a single working copy that
      contains only the modules you care about.  You'd start with an
      empty-depth checkout of the common parent directory of the
      projects, and then update with infinite depth only the items you
      wish to have, like we demonstrated in the previous example.
      Think of it like an opt-in system for working copy
      citizens.</p><p>The original (Subversion 1.5) implementation of shallow
      checkouts was good, but didn't support de-telescoping of working
      copy items.  Subversion 1.6 remedied this problem.  For example,
      running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth empty</code></strong> in
      an infinite-depth working copy will discard everything but the
      topmost directory.<sup>[<a id="idp34810400" href="#ftn.idp34810400" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup>  Subversion
      1.6 also introduced another supported value for
      the <code class="option">--set-depth</code>
      option: <code class="literal">exclude</code>.  Using <code class="option">--set-depth
      exclude</code> with <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> will cause
      the update target to be removed from the working copy
      entirelyâa directory target won't even be left
      present-but-empty.  This is especially handy when there are more
      things that you'd like to keep in a working copy than things
      you'd like to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> keep.</p><p>Consider a directory with hundreds of subdirectories, one of
      which you would like to omit from your working copy.  Using
      an <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">additive</span>â</span> approach to sparse directories, you
      might check out the directory with an empty depth, then
      explicitly telescope (using <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth
      infinity</code></strong>) each and every subdirectory of the
      directory except the one you don't care about.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

      have stubs of these directories in your working copy to deal
      with.  Such a working copy would also have another
      characteristic that you might not expect or desire: if someone
      else creates any new subdirectories in this top-level directory,
      you won't receive those when you update your working
      copy.</p><p>Beginning with Subversion 1.6, you can take a different
      approach.  First, check out the directory in full.  Then
      run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth exclude</code></strong> on the
      one subdirectory you don't care about.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>This approach leaves your working copy with the same stuff
      as in the first approach, but any new subdirectories which
      appear in the top-level directory would also show up when you
      update your working copy.  The downside of this approach is that
      you have to actually check out that whole subdirectory that you
      don't even want just so you can tell Subversion that you don't
      want it.  This might not even be possible if that subdirectory
      is too large to fit on your disk (which might, after all, be the
      very reason you don't want it in your working copy).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While the functionality for excluding an existing item

        exclusion is a completely client-side operation, very much
        unlike a typical update.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>In such a situation, you might consider a compromise
      approach.  First, check out the top-level directory
      with <code class="option">--depth immediates</code>.  Then, exclude the
      directory you don't want using <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update --set-depth

      receive itâat an empty depthâwhen you update your
      working copy.  You can now decide what to do with such newly

      and dies on its data merging algorithmsâspecifically on
      how well those algorithms perform when trying to resolve
      conflicts caused by multiple users modifying the same file
      concurrently.  Subversion itself provides only one such
      algorithm: a three-way differencing algorithm that is smart
      enough to handle data at a granularity of a single line of text.
      Subversion also allows you to supplement its content merge
      processing with external differencing utilities (as described in
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff3" title="External diff3">the section called âExternal diff3â</a> and
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externaldifftools.merge" title="External merge">the section called âExternal mergeâ</a>), some
      of which may do an even better job, perhaps providing
      granularity of a word or a single character of text.  But common
      among those algorithms is that they generally work only on text
      files.  The landscape starts to look pretty grim when you start
      talking about content merges of nontextual file formats.  And
      when you can't find a tool that can handle that type of merging,
      you begin to run into problems with the copy-modify-merge
      model.</p><p>Let's look at a real-life example of where this model runs
      aground.  Harry and Sally are both graphic designers working on
      the same project, a bit of marketing collateral for an
      automobile mechanic.  Central to the design of a particular
      poster is an image of a car in need of some bodywork, stored in
      a file using the PNG image format.  The poster's layout is
      almost finished, and both Harry and Sally are pleased with the
      particular photo they chose for their damaged carâa baby
      blue 1967 Ford Mustang with an unfortunate bit of crumpling on
      the left front fender.</p><p>Now, as is common in graphic design work, there's a change
      in plans, which causes the car's color to be a concern.  So Sally
      updates her working copy to <code class="literal">HEAD</code>, fires up
      her photo-editing software, and sets about tweaking the image so
      that the car is now cherry red.  Meanwhile, Harry, feeling
      particularly inspired that day, decides that the image would
      have greater impact if the car also appears to have suffered
      greater impact.  He, too, updates to <code class="literal">HEAD</code>,
      and then draws some cracks on the vehicle's windshield.  He
      manages to finish his work before Sally finishes hers, and after
      admiring the fruits of his undeniable talent, he commits the
      modified image.  Shortly thereafter, Sally is finished with the
      car's new finish and tries to commit her changes.  But, as
      expected, Subversion fails the commit, informing Sally that
      her version of the image is now out of date.</p><p>Here's where the difficulty sets in.  If Harry and Sally
      were making changes to a text file, Sally would simply update
      her working copy, receiving Harry's changes in the process.  In
      the worst possible case, they would have modified the same
      region of the file, and Sally would have to work out by hand the
      proper resolution to the conflict.  But these aren't text
      filesâthey are binary images.  And while it's a simple
      matter to describe what one would expect the results of this
      content merge to be, there is precious little chance that any
      software exists that is smart enough to examine the common
      baseline image that each of these graphic artists worked
      against, the changes that Harry made, and the changes that Sally
      made, and then spit out an image of a busted-up red Mustang with
      a cracked windshield!</p><p>Of course, things would have gone more smoothly if Harry and
      Sally had serialized their modifications to the imageâif,
      say, Harry had waited to draw his windshield cracks on Sally's
      now-red car, or if Sally had tweaked the color of a car whose
      windshield was already cracked.  As is discussed in
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge" title="The copy-modify-merge solution">the section called âThe copy-modify-merge solutionâ</a>, most of
      these types of problems go away entirely where perfect
      communication between Harry and Sally
      exists.<sup>[<a id="idp34840512" href="#ftn.idp34840512" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup>  But as one's version control
      system is, in fact, one form of communication, it follows that
      having that software facilitate the serialization of
      nonparallelizable editing efforts is no bad thing.  This is
      where Subversion's implementation of the lock-modify-unlock
      model steps into the spotlight.  This is where we talk about
      Subversion's <em class="firstterm">locking</em> feature, which is
      similar to the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">reserved checkouts</span>â</span> mechanisms of
      other version control systems.</p><p>Subversion's locking feature exists ultimately to minimize
      wasted time and effort.  By allowing a user to programmatically
      claim the exclusive right to change a file in the repository,
      that user can be reasonably confident that any energy he invests
      on unmergeable changes won't be wastedâhis commit of those
      changes will succeed.  Also, because Subversion communicates to
      other users that serialization is in effect for a particular
      versioned object, those users can reasonably expect that the
      object is about to be changed by someone else.  They, too, can
      then avoid wasting their time and energy on unmergeable changes
      that won't be committable due to eventual
      out-of-dateness.</p><p>When referring to Subversion's locking feature, one is
      actually talking about a fairly diverse collection of behaviors,
      which include the ability to lock a versioned
      file<sup>[<a id="idp34844384" href="#ftn.idp34844384" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup> (claiming the exclusive right to
      modify the file), to unlock that file (yielding that exclusive
      right to modify), to see reports about which files are locked
      and by whom, to annotate files for which locking before editing
      is strongly advised, and so on.  In this section, we'll cover
      all of these facets of the larger locking feature.</p><div class="sidebar" title="The Three Meanings of âLockâ"><a id="svn.advanced.locking.meanings"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>The Three Meanings of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Lock</span>â</span></strong></p></div></div></div><p>In this section, and almost everywhere in this book, the
        words <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">lock</span>â</span> and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">locking</span>â</span> describe
        a mechanism for mutual exclusion between users to avoid
        clashing commits.  Unfortunately, there are two other sorts
        of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">lock</span>â</span> with which Subversion, and therefore
        this book, sometimes needs to be concerned.</p><p>The second is <em class="firstterm">working copy locks</em>,
        used internally by Subversion to prevent clashes between
        multiple Subversion clients operating on the same working
        copy.  This is the sort of lock indicated by an
        <code class="computeroutput">L</code> in the third column of
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> output, and removed by the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn cleanup</strong></span> command, as described in <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cleanup" title="Sometimes You Just Need to Clean Up">the section called âSometimes You Just Need to Clean Upâ</a>.</p><p>Third, there are <em class="firstterm">database locks</em>,
        used internally by the Berkeley DB backend to prevent clashes
        between multiple programs trying to access the database.  This
        is the sort of lock whose unwanted persistence after an error
        can cause a repository to be <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">wedged,</span>â</span> as
        described in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.recovery" title="Berkeley DB Recovery">the section called âBerkeley DB Recoveryâ</a>.</p><p>You can generally forget about these other kinds of locks
        until something goes wrong that requires you to care about
        them.  In this book, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">lock</span>â</span> means the first sort
        unless the contrary is either clear from context or explicitly
        stated.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Creating Locks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.locking.creation"></a>Creating Locks</h3></div></div></div><p>In the Subversion repository, a
        <em class="firstterm">lock</em> is a piece of metadata that
        grants exclusive access to one user to change a file.  This
        user is said to be the <em class="firstterm">lock owner</em>.
        Each lock also has a unique identifier, typically a long
        string of characters, known as the <em class="firstterm">lock
        token</em>.  The repository manages locks, ultimately
        handling their creation, enforcement, and removal.  If any
        commit transaction attempts to modify or delete a locked file
        (or delete one of the parent directories of the file), the
        repository will demand two pieces of informationâthat
        the client performing the commit be authenticated as the lock
        owner, and that the lock token has been provided as part of
        the commit process as a form of proof that the client knows which
        lock it is using.</p><p>To demonstrate lock creation, let's refer back to our
        example of multiple graphic designers working on the same
        binary image files.  Harry has decided to change a JPEG image.
        To prevent other people from committing changes to the file
        while he is modifying it (as well as alerting them that he is
        about to change it), he locks the file in the repository using
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span> command.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn lock banana.jpg -m "Editing file for tomorrow's release."
'banana.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.
$
</pre></div><p>The preceding example demonstrates a number of new things.
        First, notice that Harry passed the
        <code class="option">--message</code> (<code class="option">-m</code>) option to
        <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>.  Similar to <span class="command"><strong>svn
        commit</strong></span>, the <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span> command can
        take commentsâvia either <code class="option">--message</code>
        (<code class="option">-m</code>) or <code class="option">--file</code>
        (<code class="option">-F</code>)âto describe the reason for locking the
        file.  Unlike <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>, however,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span> will not demand a message by
        launching your preferred text editor.  Lock comments are
        optional, but still recommended to aid communication.</p><p>Second, the lock attempt succeeded.  This means that the
        file wasn't already locked, and that Harry had the latest
        version of the file.  If Harry's working copy of the file had
        been out of date, the repository would have rejected the
        request, forcing Harry to <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and
        reattempt the locking command.  The locking command would also
        have failed if the file had already been locked by someone
        else.</p><p>As you can see, the <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span> command
        prints confirmation of the successful lock.  At this point,
        the fact that the file is locked becomes apparent in the
        output of the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        info</strong></span> reporting subcommands.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>The fact that the <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> command,
        which does not contact the repository when run against working
        copy paths, can display the lock token reveals an important
        piece of information about those tokens:  they are cached in
        the working copy.  The presence of the lock token is critical.
        It gives the working copy authorization to make use of the
        lock later on.  Also, the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
        command shows a <code class="literal">K</code> next to the file (short
        for locKed), indicating that the lock token is present.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Regarding Lock Tokens"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Regarding Lock Tokens</strong></p></div></div></div><p>A lock token isn't an authentication token, so much as
          an <span class="emphasis"><em>authorization</em></span> token.  The token
          isn't a protected secret.  In fact, a lock's unique token is
          discoverable by anyone who runs <strong class="userinput"><code>svn info
          <em class="replaceable"><code>URL</code></em></code></strong>.  A lock token is
          special only when it lives inside a working copy.  It's
          proof that the lock was created in that particular working
          copy, and not somewhere else by some other client.  Merely
          authenticating as the lock owner isn't enough to prevent
          accidents.</p><p>For example, suppose you lock a file using a computer at
          your office, but leave work for the day before you finish
          your changes to that file.  It should not be possible to
          accidentally commit changes to that same file from your home
          computer later that evening simply because you've
          authenticated as the lock's owner.  In other words, the lock
          token prevents one piece of Subversion-related software from
          undermining the work of another.  (In our example, if you
          really need to change the file from an alternative working
          copy, you would need to <em class="firstterm">break</em> the
          lock and relock the file.)</p></div><p>Now that Harry has locked <code class="filename">banana.jpg</code>,
        Sally is unable to change or delete that file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn delete banana.jpg
D         banana.jpg
$ svn commit -m "Delete useless file."
Deleting       banana.jpg
svn: E175002: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: E175002: Server sent unexpected return value (423 Locked) in response to 
DELETE request for '/repos/project/!svn/wrk/64bad3a9-96f9-0310-818a-df4224ddc
35d/banana.jpg'
$
</pre></div><p>But Harry, after touching up the banana's shade of yellow,
        is able to commit his changes to the file.  That's because he
        authenticates as the lock owner and also because his working
        copy holds the correct lock token:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M    K  banana.jpg
$ svn commit -m "Make banana more yellow"
Sending        banana.jpg
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2201.
$ svn status
$
</pre></div><p>Notice that after the commit is finished, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> shows that the lock token is no longer
        present in the working copy.  This is the standard behavior of
        <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>âit searches the working
        copy (or list of targets, if you provide such a list) for
        local modifications and sends all the lock tokens it
        encounters during this walk to the server as part of the
        commit transaction.  After the commit completes successfully,
        all of the repository locks that were mentioned are
        releasedâ<span class="emphasis"><em>even on files that weren't
        committed</em></span>.  This is meant to discourage users from
        being sloppy about locking or from holding locks for too long.
        If Harry haphazardly locks 30 files in a directory named
        <code class="filename">images</code> because he's unsure of which files
        he needs to change, yet changes only four of those files, when he
        runs <strong class="userinput"><code>svn commit images</code></strong>, the process will
        still release all 30 locks.</p><p>This behavior of automatically releasing locks can be
        overridden with the <code class="option">--no-unlock</code> option to
        <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>.  This is best used for those
        times when you want to commit changes, but still plan to make
        more changes and thus need to retain existing locks.  You can
        also make this your default behavior by setting the
        <code class="literal">no-unlock</code> runtime configuration option (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ</a>).</p><p>Of course, locking a file doesn't oblige one to commit a
        change to it.  The lock can be released at any time with a
        simple <span class="command"><strong>svn unlock</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn unlock banana.c
'banana.c' unlocked.
</pre></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Discovering Locks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.locking.discovery"></a>Discovering Locks</h3></div></div></div><p>When a commit fails due to someone else's locks, it's
        fairly easy to learn about them.  The easiest way is to run
        <strong class="userinput"><code>svn status -u</code></strong>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status -u
M               23   bar.c
M    O          32   raisin.jpg
        *       72   foo.h
Status against revision:     105
$
</pre></div><p>In this example, Sally can see not only that her copy of
        <code class="filename">foo.h</code> is out of date, but also that one of the
        two modified files she plans to commit is locked in the
        repository.  The <code class="literal">O</code> symbol stands for
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Other,</span>â</span> meaning that a lock exists on the file
        and was created by somebody else.  If she were to attempt a
        commit, the lock on <code class="filename">raisin.jpg</code> would
        prevent it.  Sally is left wondering who made the lock, when,
        and why.  Once again, <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> has the
        answers:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Just as you can use <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> to examine
        objects in the working copy, you can also use it to examine
        objects in the repository.  If the main argument to
        <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> is a working copy path, then all
        of the working copy's cached information is displayed; any
        mention of a lock means that the working copy is holding a
        lock token (if a file is locked by another user or in another
        working copy, <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> on a working copy
        path will show no lock information at all).  If the main
        argument to <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> is a URL, the
        information reflects the latest version of an object in the
        repository, and any mention of a lock describes the current
        lock on the object.</p><p>So in this particular example, Sally can see that Harry
        locked the file on February 16 to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">make a quick
        tweak.</span>â</span>  It being June, she suspects that he probably
        forgot all about the lock.  She might phone Harry to complain
        and ask him to release the lock.  If he's unavailable, she
        might try to forcibly break the lock herself or ask an
        administrator to do so.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Breaking and Stealing Locks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.locking.break-steal"></a>Breaking and Stealing Locks</h3></div></div></div><p>A repository lock isn't sacredâin Subversion's
        default configuration state, locks can be released not only by
        the person who created them, but by anyone.  When somebody
        other than the original lock creator destroys a lock, we refer
        to this as <em class="firstterm">breaking the lock</em>.</p><p>From the administrator's chair, it's simple to break
        locks.  The <span class="command"><strong>svnlook</strong></span>
        and <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> programs have the ability to
        display and remove locks directly from the repository.  (For
        more information about these tools, see

$ svnadmin rmlocks /var/svn/repos /project/raisin.jpg
Removed lock on '/project/raisin.jpg'.
$
</pre></div><p>The more interesting option is to allow users to break
        each other's locks over the network.  To do this, Sally simply
        needs to pass the <code class="option">--force</code> to the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        unlock</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status -u
M               23   bar.c
M    O          32   raisin.jpg
        *       72   foo.h
Status against revision:     105
$ svn unlock raisin.jpg
svn: E195013: 'raisin.jpg' is not locked in this working copy
$ svn info raisin.jpg | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
$ svn unlock http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
svn: warning: W160039: Unlock failed on 'raisin.jpg' (403 Forbidden)
$ svn unlock --force http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' unlocked.
$
</pre></div><p>Now, Sally's initial attempt to unlock failed because she
        ran <span class="command"><strong>svn unlock</strong></span> directly on her working copy
        of the file, and no lock token was present.  To remove the
        lock directly from the repository, she needs to pass a URL
        to <span class="command"><strong>svn unlock</strong></span>.  Her first attempt to unlock
        the URL fails, because she can't authenticate as the lock
        owner (nor does she have the lock token).  But when she
        passes <code class="option">--force</code>, the authentication and
        authorization requirements are ignored, and the remote lock is
        broken.</p><p>Simply breaking a lock may not be enough.  In
        the running example, Sally may not only want to break Harry's
        long-forgotten lock, but relock the file for her own use.
        She can accomplish this by using <span class="command"><strong>svn unlock</strong></span>
        with <code class="option">--force</code> and then <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>
        back-to-back, but there's a small chance that somebody else
        might lock the file between the two commands.  The simpler thing
        to do is to <em class="firstterm">steal</em> the lock, which involves
        breaking and relocking the file all in one atomic step.  To
        do this, Sally passes the <code class="option">--force</code> option
        to <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn lock raisin.jpg
svn: warning: W160035: Path '/project/raisin.jpg' is already locked by user 'h
arry' in filesystem '/var/svn/repos/db'
$ svn lock --force raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' locked by user 'sally'.
$
</pre></div><p>In any case, whether the lock is broken or stolen, Harry
        may be in for a surprise.  Harry's working copy still contains
        the original lock token, but that lock no longer exists.  The
        lock token is said to be <em class="firstterm">defunct</em>.  The
        lock represented by the lock token has either been broken (no
        longer in the repository) or stolen (replaced with a
        different lock).  Either way, Harry can see this by asking
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> to contact the
        repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
     K  raisin.jpg
$ svn status -u
     B          32   raisin.jpg
Status against revision:     105
$ svn update
Updating '.':
  B  raisin.jpg
Updated to revision 105.
$ svn status
$
</pre></div><p>If the repository lock was broken, then <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
        status --show-updates</code></strong> (<code class="option">-u</code>)
        displays a <code class="literal">B</code> (Broken) symbol next to the
        file.  If a new lock exists in place of the old one, then a
        <code class="literal">T</code> (sTolen) symbol is shown.  Finally,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> notices any defunct lock tokens
        and removes them from the working copy.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Locking Policies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Locking Policies</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Different systems have different notions of how strict a
          lock should be.  Some folks argue that locks must be
          strictly enforced at all costs, releasable only by the
          original creator or administrator.  They argue that if
          anyone can break a lock, chaos runs rampant and the
          whole point of locking is defeated.  The other side argues
          that locks are first and foremost a communication tool.  If
          users are constantly breaking each other's locks, it
          represents a cultural failure within the team and the
          problem falls outside the scope of software enforcement.</p><p>Subversion defaults to the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">softer</span>â</span>
          approach, but still allows administrators to create stricter
          enforcement policies through the use of hook scripts.  In
          particular, the <code class="filename">pre-lock</code> and
          <code class="filename">pre-unlock</code> hooks allow administrators
          to decide when lock creation and lock releases are allowed
          to happen.  Depending on whether a lock already exists,
          these two hooks can decide whether to allow a certain user
          to break or steal a lock.  The
          <code class="filename">post-lock</code> and
          <code class="filename">post-unlock</code> hooks are also available,
          and can be used to send email after locking actions.  To
          learn more about repository hooks, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks" title="Implementing Repository Hooks">the section called âImplementing Repository Hooksâ</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Lock Communication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.locking.lock-communication"></a>Lock Communication</h3></div></div></div><p>We've seen how <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>
        and <span class="command"><strong>svn unlock</strong></span> can be used to create,
        release, break, and steal locks.  This satisfies the goal of
        serializing commit access to a file.  But what about the
        larger problem of preventing wasted time?</p><p>For example, suppose Harry locks an image file and then
        begins editing it.  Meanwhile, miles away, Sally wants to do
        the same thing.  She doesn't think to run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn status
        -u</code></strong>, so she has no idea that Harry has
        already locked the file.  She spends hours editing the file,
        and when she tries to commit her change, she discovers that
        either the file is locked or that she's out of date.
        Regardless, her changes aren't mergeable with Harry's.  One of
        these two people has to throw away his or her work, and a lot of
        time has been wasted.</p><p>Subversion's solution to this problem is to provide a
        mechanism to remind users that a file ought to be locked
        <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the editing begins.  The mechanism
        is a special property:  <code class="literal">svn:needs-lock</code>.  If
        that property is attached to a file (regardless of its value,
        which is irrelevant), Subversion will try to use
        filesystem-level permissions to make the file read-onlyâunless,
        of course, the user has explicitly locked the file.
        When a lock token is present (as a result of using
        <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>), the file becomes read/write.
        When the lock is released, the file becomes read-only
        again.</p><p>The theory, then, is that if the image file has this
        property attached, Sally would immediately notice
        something is strange when she opens the file for editing:
        many applications alert users immediately when a read-only
        file is opened for editing, and nearly all would
        prevent her from saving changes to the file.  This
        reminds her to lock the file before editing, whereby she
        discovers the preexisting lock:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        day, there's simply no substitution for good interpersonal
        communication.<sup>[<a id="idp34953680" href="#ftn.idp34953680" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup></p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Externals Definitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.externals"></a>Externals Definitions</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes it is useful to construct a working copy that is
      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different subdirectories to come from different
      locations in a repository or perhaps from different
      repositories altogether.  You could certainly set up such a
      scenario by handâusing <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> to
      create the sort of nested working copy structure you are trying
      to achieve.  But if this layout is important for everyone who
      uses your repository, every other user will need to perform the
      same checkout operations that you did.</p><p>Fortunately, Subversion provides support for
      <em class="firstterm">externals definitions</em>.  An externals
      definition is a mapping of a local directory to the
      URLâand ideally a particular revisionâof a versioned
      directory.  In Subversion, you declare externals definitions in
      groups using the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property.  You
      can create or modify this property using <span class="command"><strong>svn

      once one person has made the effort to define the nested working
      copy structure, no one else has to botherâSubversion will,
      after checking out the original working copy, automatically also
      check out the external working copies.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The relative target subdirectories of externals

      Subversion repository URLs.  An example of this might look as
      follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

      <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is supported.
      Externals definitions are still multiline, but the order and
      format of the various pieces of information have changed.  The
      new syntax more closely mimics the order of arguments you might
      pass to <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>: the optional revision
      flags come first, then the external Subversion repository URL,
      and finally the relative local subdirectory.  Notice, though,
      that this time we didn't say <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">fully qualified, absolute
      Subversion repository URLs.</span>â</span> That's because the new
      format supports relative URLs and URLs that carry peg revisions.
      The previous example of an externals definition might, in
      Subversion 1.5, look like the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc

      in detail in <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.pegrevs" title="Peg and Operative Revisions">the section called âPeg and Operative Revisionsâ</a>), it might
      appear as:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        numbers in all of your externals definitions.  Doing so means
        that you get to decide when to pull down a different snapshot
        of external information, and exactly which snapshot to pull.
        Besides avoiding the surprise of getting changes to
        third-party repositories that you might not have any control
        over, using explicit revision numbers also means that as you
        backdate your working copy to a previous revision, your
        externals definitions will also revert to the way they looked
        in that previous revision, which in turn means that the
        external working copies will be updated to match the way
        <span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> looked back when your repository was
        at that previous revision.  For software projects, this could
        be the difference between a successful and a failed build of
        an older snapshot of your complex codebase.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>For most repositories, these three ways of formatting the
      externals definitions have the same ultimate effect.  They all
      bring the same benefits.  Unfortunately, they all bring the same
      annoyances, too.  Since the definitions shown use absolute URLs,
      moving or copying a directory to which they are attached will
      not affect what gets checked out as an external (though the
      relative local target subdirectory will, of course, move with the
      renamed directory).  This can be confusingâeven
      frustratingâin certain situations.  For example, say you
      have a top-level directory named
      <code class="filename">my-project</code>, and you've created an externals
      definition on one of its subdirectories
      (<code class="filename">my-project/some-dir</code>) that tracks the
      latest revision of another of its subdirectories
      (<code class="filename">my-project/external-dir</code>).</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

$
</pre></div><p>Also, absolute URLs can cause problems with repositories
      that are available via multiple URL schemes.  For example, if
      your Subversion server is configured to allow everyone to check
      out the repository over <code class="literal">http://</code> or
      <code class="literal">https://</code>, but only allow commits to come in
      via <code class="literal">https://</code>, you have an interesting problem
      on your hands.  If your externals definitions use the
      <code class="literal">http://</code> form of the repository URLs, you
      won't be able to commit anything from the working copies created
      by those externals.  On the other hand, if they use the
      <code class="literal">https://</code> form of the URLs, anyone who might
      be checking out via <code class="literal">http://</code> because his
      client doesn't support <code class="literal">https://</code> will be
      unable to fetch the external items.  Be aware, too, that if you
      need to reparent your working copy (using <span class="command"><strong>svn
      relocate</strong></span>), externals definitions will
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> also be reparented.</p><p>Subversion 1.5 takes a huge step in relieving these
     frustrations.  As mentioned earlier, the URLs used in the new
     externals definition format can be relative, and Subversion
     provides syntax magic for specifying multiple flavors of URL
     relativity.</p><div class="variablelist"><a id="svn.advanced.externals.urlmagic"></a><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">../</code></span></dt><dd><p>Relative to the URL of the directory on which

      definition example, and making use of the new absolute URL
      syntax in various ways, we might now see:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

$
</pre></div><p>Subversion 1.6 brought two more improvements to externals
      definitions.  First, it added a quoting and escape mechanism to
      the syntax so that the path of the external working copy may
      contain whitespace.  This was previously problematic, of course,
      because whitespace is used to delimit the fields in an externals
      definition.  Now you need only wrap such a path specification in
      double-quote (<code class="literal">"</code>) characters or
      escape the problematic characters in the path with a backslash
      (<code class="literal">\</code>) character.  Of course, if you have spaces
      in the <span class="emphasis"><em>URL</em></span> portion of the external
      definition, you should use the standard URI-encoding mechanism
      to represent those.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals paint

http://svn.thirdparty.com/repos/%22Quotes%20Too%22 \"Quotes\ Too\"
$
</pre></div><p>Subversion 1.6 also introduced support for external
      definitions for files.  <em class="firstterm">File externals</em>
      are configured just like externals for directories and appear as
      a versioned file in the working copy.</p><p>For example, let's say you had the file
      <code class="filename">/trunk/bikeshed/blue.html</code> in your repository,
      and you wanted this file, as it appeared in revision 40,
      to appear in your working copy of <code class="filename">/trunk/www/</code>
      as <code class="filename">green.html</code>.</p><p>The externals definition required to achieve this should
      look familiar by now:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>As you can see in the previous output, Subversion denotes file
      externals with the letter <code class="literal">E</code> when they are
      fetched into the working copy, and with the letter
      <code class="literal">X</code> when showing the working copy status.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While directory externals can place the external

      <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span>, you can see the URL and revision
      the external is coming from:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Because file externals appear in the working copy as
      versioned files, they can be modified and even committed
      if they reference a file at the HEAD revision. The committed
      changes will then appear in the external as well as the file
      referenced by the external. However, in our example, we pinned
      the external to an older revision, so attempting to commit
      the external fails:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M   X   www/green.html
$ svn commit -m "change the color" www/green.html
Sending        www/green.html
svn: E155011: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: E155011: File '/trunk/bikeshed/blue.html' is out of date
$
</pre></div><p>Keep this in mind when defining file externals.
      If you need the external to refer to a certain revision
      of a file you will not be able to modify the external.
      If you want to be able to modify the external, you cannot
      specify a revision other than the <code class="literal">HEAD</code>
      revision, which is implied if no revision is specified.</p><p>Unfortunately, the support which exists for externals definitions
      in Subversion remains less than ideal.  Both file and directory
      externals have shortcomings. For either type of external, the
      local subdirectory part of the definition cannot contain
      <code class="literal">..</code> parent directory indicators (such as
      <code class="filename">../../skins/myskin</code>).  File externals cannot
      refer to files from other repositories. A file external's URL
      must always be in the same repository as the URL that the file
      external will be inserted into. Also, file externals cannot be
      moved or deleted. The <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property
      must be modified instead. However, file externals can be copied.</p><p>Perhaps most disappointingly, the working copies created via the
      externals definition support are still disconnected from the primary
      working copy (on whose versioned directories the
      <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property was actually set).
      And Subversion still truly operates only on nondisjoint working
      copies.  So, for example, if you want to commit changes that
      you've made in one or more of those external working copies, you
      must run <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> explicitly on those
      working copiesâcommitting on the primary working copy will
      not recurse into any external ones.</p><p>We've already mentioned some of the additional shortcomings
      of the old <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> format and how the
      newer Subversion 1.5 format improves upon it.  But be careful
      when making use of the new format that you don't inadvertently
      introduce new problems.  For example, while the latest clients
      will continue to recognize and support the original externals
      definition format, pre-1.5 clients will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      be able to correctly parse the new format.  If you change all
      your externals definitions to the newer format, you effectively
      force everyone who uses those externals to upgrade their
      Subversion clients to a version that can parse them.  Also, be
      careful to avoid naively relocating
      the <code class="literal">-r<em class="replaceable"><code>NNN</code></em></code> portion
      of the definitionâthe older format uses that revision as a
      peg revision, but the newer format uses it as an operative
      revision (with a peg revision of <code class="literal">HEAD</code> unless
      otherwise specified; see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.pegrevs" title="Peg and Operative Revisions">the section called âPeg and Operative Revisionsâ</a>
      for a full explanation of the distinction here).</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>External working copies are still completely
        self-sufficient working copies.  You can operate directly on
        them as you would any other working copy.  This can be a handy
        feature, allowing you to examine an external working copy
        independently of any primary working copy
        whose <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property caused its
        instantiation.  Be careful, though, that you don't
        inadvertently modify your external working copy in subtle ways
        that cause problems.  For example, while an externals
        definition might specify that the external working copy should
        be held at a particular revision number, if you
        run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> directly on the external
        working copy, Subversion will oblige, and now your external
        working copy is out of sync with its declaration in the
        primary working copy.  Using <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> to
        directly switch the external working copy (or some portion
        thereof) to another URL could cause similar problems if the

      status</strong></span> command also recognizes externals definitions.
      It displays a status code of <code class="literal">X</code> for the
      disjoint external subdirectories, and then recurses into those
      subdirectories to display the status of the external items
      themselves.  You can pass the
      <code class="option">--ignore-externals</code> option to any of these
      subcommands to disable externals definition processing.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Changelists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.changelists"></a>Changelists</h2></div></div></div><p>It is commonplace for a developer to find himself working at
      any given time on multiple different, distinct changes to a
      particular bit of source code.  This isn't necessarily due to
      poor planning or some form of digital masochism.  A software
      engineer often spots bugs in his peripheral vision while working
      on some nearby chunk of source code.  Or perhaps he's halfway
      through some large change when he realizes the solution he's
      working on is best committed as several smaller logical units.
      Often, these logical units aren't nicely contained in some
      module, safely separated from other changes.  The units might
      overlap, modifying different files in the same module, or even
      modifying different lines in the same file.</p><p>Developers can employ various work methodologies
      to keep these logical changes organized.  Some use
      separate working copies of the same repository to hold each
      individual change in progress.  Others might choose to create
      short-lived feature branches in the repository and use a single
      working copy that is constantly switched to point to one such
      branch or another.  Still others use <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> tools to back up and restore uncommitted
      changes to and from patch files associated with each change.
      Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and to a large
      degree, the details of the changes being made heavily influence
      the methodology used to distinguish them.</p><p>Subversion provides a <em class="firstterm">changelists</em>
      feature that adds yet another method to the mix.  Changelists
      are basically arbitrary labels (currently at most one per file)
      applied to working copy files for the express purpose of
      associating multiple files together.  Users of many of Google's
      software offerings are familiar with this concept already.  For
      example, <a class="ulink" href="http://mail.google.com/" target="_top">Gmail</a>
      doesn't provide the traditional folders-based email organization
      mechanism.  In Gmail, you apply arbitrary labels to emails, and
      multiple emails can be said to be part of the same group if they
      happen to share a particular label.  Viewing only a group of
      similarly labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface
      trick.  Many other Web 2.0 sites have similar
      mechanismsâconsider the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">tags</span>â</span> used by sites
      such as <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_top">YouTube</a> and
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_top">Flickr</a>,
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">categories</span>â</span> applied to blog posts, and so on.
      Folks understand today that organization of data is critical,
      but that how that data is organized needs to be a flexible
      concept.  The old files-and-folders paradigm is too rigid for
      some applications.</p><p>Subversion's changelist support allows you to create
      changelists by applying labels to files you want to be
      associated with that changelist, remove those labels, and limit
      the scope of the files on which its subcommands operate to only
      those bearing a particular label.  In this section, we'll look
      in detail at how to do these things.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creating and Modifying Changelists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.changelists.creating"></a>Creating and Modifying Changelists</h3></div></div></div><p>You can create, modify, and delete changelists using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn changelist</strong></span> command.  More accurately,
        you use this command to set or unset the changelist
        association of a particular working copy file.  A changelist
        is effectively created the first time you label a file with
        that changelist; it is deleted when you remove that label from
        the last file that had it.  Let's examine a usage scenario
        that demonstrates these concepts.</p><p>Harry is fixing some bugs in the calculator application's
        mathematics logic.  His work leads him to change a couple of
        files:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre></div><p>While testing his bug fix, Harry notices that his changes
        bring to light a tangentially related bug in the user
        interface logic found in <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  Harry
        decides that he'll go ahead and fix that bug, too, as a
        separate commit from his math fixes.  Now, in a small working
        copy with only a handful of files and few logical changes,
        Harry can probably keep his two logical change groupings
        mentally organized without any problem.  But today he's going
        to use Subversion's changelists feature as a special favor to
        the authors of this book.</p><p>Harry first creates a changelist and associates with it
        the two files he's already changed.  He does this by using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn changelist</strong></span> command to assign the same
        arbitrary changelist name to those files:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-fixes integer.c mathops.c
A [math-fixes] integer.c
A [math-fixes] mathops.c
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre></div><p>As you can see, the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> reflects this new grouping.</p><p>Harry now sets off to fix the secondary UI problem.  Since
        he knows which file he'll be changing, he assigns that path to
        a changelist, too.  Unfortunately, Harry carelessly assigns this
        third file to the same changelist as the previous two files:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist math-fixes button.c
A [math-fixes] button.c
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
        button.c
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre></div><p>Fortunately, Harry catches his mistake.  At this point, he
        has two options.  He can remove the changelist association
        from <code class="filename">button.c</code>, and then assign a
        different changelist name:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist --remove button.c
D [math-fixes] button.c
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
A [ui-fix] button.c
$
</pre></div><p>Or, he can skip the removal and just assign a new
        changelist name.  In this case, Subversion will first warn
        Harry that <code class="filename">button.c</code> is being removed from
        the first changelist:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
D [math-fixes] button.c
A [ui-fix] button.c
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
        button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M       integer.c
M       mathops.c
$
</pre></div><p>Harry now has two distinct changelists present in his
        working copy, and <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> will group its
        output according to these changelist determinations.  Notice
        that even though Harry hasn't yet modified
        <code class="filename">button.c</code>, it still shows up in the output
        of <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> as interesting because it has
        a changelist assignment.  Changelists can be added to and
        removed from files at any time, regardless of whether they
        contain local modifications.</p><p>Harry now fixes the user interface problem in
        <code class="filename">button.c</code>.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
M       button.c

        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> as shown in our previous section
        is nice, but not entirely useful.  The
        <span class="command"><strong>status</strong></span> command is but one of many
        operations that he might wish to perform on his working copy.
        Fortunately, many of Subversion's other operations understand
        how to operate on changelists via the use of the
        <code class="option">--changelist</code> option.</p><p>When provided with a <code class="option">--changelist</code> option,
        Subversion commands will limit the scope of their operation to
        only those files to which a particular changelist name is
        assigned.  If Harry now wants to see the actual changes he's
        made to the files in his <code class="literal">math-fixes</code>
        changelist, he <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> explicitly list only
        the files that make up that changelist on the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span> command line.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn diff integer.c mathops.c

===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
â¦
$
</pre></div><p>That works okay for a few files, but what if Harry's
        change touched 20 or 30 files?  That would be an annoyingly
        long list of explicitly named files.  Now that he's using
        changelists, though, Harry can avoid explicitly listing the
        set of files in his changelist from now on, and instead
        provide just the changelist name:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn diff --changelist math-fixes
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)

â¦
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
â¦
$
</pre></div><p>And when it's time to commit, Harry can again use the
        <code class="option">--changelist</code> option to limit the scope of the
        commit to files in a certain changelist.  He might commit his
        user interface fix by doing the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn commit -m "Fix a UI bug found while working on math logic." \
             --changelist ui-fix

Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1158.
$
</pre></div><p>In fact, the <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command
        provides a second changelists-related option:
        <code class="option">--keep-changelists</code>.  Normally, changelist
        assignments are removed from files after they are committed.
        But if <code class="option">--keep-changelists</code> is provided,
        Subversion will leave the changelist assignment on the
        committed (and now unmodified) files.  In any case, committing
        files assigned to one changelist leaves other changelists
        undisturbed.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          specified as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn commit /path/to/dir</code></strong>, the
          target is the directory <code class="filename">/path/to/dir</code>
          and its children (to infinite depth).  If you then add a
          changelist specifier to that command, only those files in
          and under <code class="filename">/path/to/dir</code> that are
          assigned that changelist name will be considered as targets
          of the commitâthe commit will not include files
          located elsewhere (such as in
          <code class="filename">/path/to/another-dir</code>), regardless of
          their changelist assignment, even if they are part of the

        <code class="option">--changelist</code> option on a single command
        line.  Doing so limits the operation you are performing to

        grouping working copy files, but it does have a few limitations.
        Changelists are artifacts of a particular working copy, which
        means that changelist assignments cannot be propagated to the
        repository or otherwise shared with other users.  Changelists
        can be assigned only to filesâSubversion doesn't
        currently support the use of changelists with directories.
        Finally, you can have at most one changelist assignment on a
        given working copy file.  Here is where the blog post category
        and photo service tag analogies break downâif you find
        yourself needing to assign a file to multiple changelists,
        you're out of luck.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Network Model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel"></a>Network Model</h2></div></div></div><p>At some point, you're going to need to understand how your
      Subversion client communicates with its server.  Subversion's
      networking layer is abstracted, meaning that Subversion clients
      exhibit the same general behaviors no matter what sort of server
      they are operating against.  Whether speaking the HTTP protocol
      (<code class="literal">http://</code>) with the Apache HTTP Server or
      speaking the custom Subversion protocol
      (<code class="literal">svn://</code>) with <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>,
      the basic network model is the same.  In this section, we'll
      explain the basics of that network model, including how
      Subversion manages authentication and authorization
      matters.</p><div class="sect2" title="Requests and Responses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.reqresp"></a>Requests and Responses</h3></div></div></div><p>The Subversion client spends most of its time managing
        working copies.  When it needs information from a remote
        repository, however, it makes a network request, and the
        server responds with an appropriate answer.  The details of
        the network protocol are hidden from the userâthe client
        attempts to access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a
        particular protocol is used to contact the server (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.reposurls" title="Addressing the Repository">the section called âAddressing the Repositoryâ</a>).</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong> to see which
          URL schemes and protocols the client knows how to use.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>When the server process receives a client request, it
        often demands that the client identify itself.  It issues
        an authentication challenge to the client, and the client
        responds by providing <em class="firstterm">credentials</em> back
        to the server.  Once authentication is complete, the server
        responds with the original information that the client asked for.
        Notice that this system is different from systems such as CVS,
        where the client preemptively offers credentials (<span class="quote">â<span class="quote">logs
        in</span>â</span>) to the server before ever making a request.  In
        Subversion, the server <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pulls</span>â</span> credentials by
        challenging the client at the appropriate moment, rather than
        the client <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pushing</span>â</span> them.  This makes certain
        operations more elegant.  For example, if a server is
        configured to allow anyone in the world to read a repository,
        the server will never issue an authentication challenge
        when a client attempts to <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>.</p><p>If the particular network requests issued by the client
        result in a new revision being created in the repository
        (e.g., <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>), Subversion uses the
        authenticated username associated with those requests as the
        author of the revision.  That is, the authenticated user's
        name is stored as the value of the
        <code class="literal">svn:author</code> property on the new revision
        (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.properties" title="Subversion Properties">the section called âSubversion Propertiesâ</a> in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>).  If the client was not
        authenticated (i.e., if the server never issued an
        authentication challenge), the revision's
        <code class="literal">svn:author</code> property is empty.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Client Credentials"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.creds"></a>Client Credentials</h3></div></div></div><p>Many Subversion servers are configured to require
        authentication.  Sometimes anonymous read operations are
        allowed, while write operations must be authenticated.  In
        other cases, reads and writes alike require authentication.
        Subversion's different server options understand different
        authentication protocols, but from the user's point of view,
        authentication typically boils down to usernames and
        passwords.  Subversion clients offer several different ways to
        retrieve and store a user's authentication credentials, from
        interactive prompting for usernames and passwords to encrypted
        and non-encrypted on-disk data caches.</p><p>The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately
        that there is reason for concern here.  <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Caching
        passwords on disk?  That's terrible!  You should never do
        that!</span>â</span>  Don't worryâit's not as bad as it sounds.
        The following sections discuss the various types of credential
        caches that Subversion uses, when it uses them, and how to
        disable that functionality in whole or in part.</p><div class="sect3" title="Caching credentials"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"></a>Caching credentials</h4></div></div></div><p>Subversion offers a remedy for the annoyance caused when
          users are forced to type their usernames and passwords over
          and over again.  By default, whenever the command-line
          client successfully responds to a server's authentication
          challenge, credentials are cached on disk and keyed on a
          combination of the server's hostname, port, and
          authentication realm.  This cache will then be automatically
          consulted in the future, avoiding the need for the user to
          re-type his or her authentication credentials.  If seemingly
          suitable credentials are not present in the cache, or if the
          cached credentials ultimately fail to authenticate, the
          client will, by default, fall back to prompting the user for
          the necessary information.</p><p>The Subversion developers recognize that on-disk caches
          of authentication credentials can be a security risk.  To
          offset this, Subversion works with available mechanisms
          provided by the operating system and environment to try to
          minimize the risk of leaking this information.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>On Windows, the Subversion client stores passwords
              in the <code class="filename">%APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/</code>
              directory.  On Windows 2000 and later, the standard
              Windows cryptography services are used to encrypt the
              password on disk.  Because the encryption key is managed
              by Windows and is tied to the user's own login
              credentials, only the user can decrypt the cached
              password.  (Note that if the user's Windows account
              password is reset by an administrator, all of the cached
              passwords become undecipherable.  The Subversion client
              will behave as though they don't exist, prompting for
              passwords when required.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores
              all repository passwords in the login keyring (managed
              by the Keychain service), which is protected by the
              user's account password.  User preference settings can
              impose additional policies, such as requiring that the
              user's account password be entered each time the
              Subversion password is used.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For other Unix-like operating systems, no single
              standard <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">keychain</span>â</span> service exists.
              However, the Subversion client knows how to store
              passwords securely using the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">GNOME Keyring</span>â</span>
              and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">KDE Wallet</span>â</span> services.  Also, before
              storing unencrypted passwords in the
              <code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code> caching area,
              the Subversion client will ask the user for permission
              to do so.  Note that the <code class="filename">auth/</code>
              caching area is still permission-protected so that only
              the user (owner) can read data from it, not the world at
              large.  The operating system's own file permissions protect
              the passwords from other non-administrative users on the
              same system, provided they have no direct physical access
              to the storage media of the home directory, or backups
              thereof.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these
          mechanisms meets the test of perfection.  So for those folks
          willing to sacrifice convenience for the ultimate in security,

          authentication data.  In those situations, Subversion will

          the <code class="option">--username</code>
          and <code class="option">--password</code> options, which allow you to
          specify your username and password, respectively, so that
          Subversion isn't forced to prompt you for that information.
          This is especially handy if you need to invoke Subversion
          from a script and cannot rely on Subversion being able to
          locate valid cached credentials for you.  These options are
          also helpful when Subversion has already cached
          authentication credentials for you, but you know they aren't
          the ones you want it to use.  Perhaps several system users
          share a login to the system, but each have distinct
          Subversion identities.  You can omit
          the <code class="option">--password</code> option from this pair if
          you wish Subversion to use only the provided username, but
          still prompt you for that username's password.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Authentication wrap-up"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.initial.authn-wrapup"></a>Authentication wrap-up</h4></div></div></div><p>One last word about <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>'s
          authentication behavior, specifically regarding the
          <code class="option">--username</code> and <code class="option">--password</code>
          options.  Many client subcommands accept these options, but it
          is important to understand that using these options does
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automatically send credentials to the
          server.  As discussed earlier, the server <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pulls</span>â</span>
          credentials from the client when it deems necessary; the
          client cannot <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">push</span>â</span> them at will.  If a username
          and/or password are passed as options, they will be
          presented to the server only if the server requests them.  These
          options are typically used to authenticate as a different user
          than Subversion would have chosen by default (such as your
          system login name) or when trying to avoid interactive
          prompting (such as when calling <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> from a

              <code class="option">--password</code>).  If so, the client will try

              <code class="filename">auth/</code> area, to see whether appropriate 
              credentials are cached there.  If so, it attempts to use
              those credentials to authenticate.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Finally, if the previous mechanisms failed to
              successfully authenticate the user against the server, the

    to them.  If you've not familiarized yourself with Subversion's
    basic concepts (found in <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic" title="ChapterÂ 1.Â Fundamental Concepts">ChapterÂ 1, <em>Fundamental Concepts</em></a>), we
    recommmend that you do so before reading this chapter.</p><div class="sect1" title="What's a Branch?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.branchmerge.whatis"></a>What's a Branch?</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose it's your job to maintain a document for a division

      division asks you for the same handbook, but with a few parts
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">tweaked</span>â</span> for them, since they do things slightly
      differently.</p><p>What do you do in this situation?  You do the obvious: make
      a second copy of your document and begin maintaining the two
      copies separately.  As each department asks you to make small
      changes, you incorporate them into one copy or the other.</p><p>You often want to make the same change to both copies.  For
      example, if you discover a typo in the first copy, it's very
      likely that the same typo exists in the second copy.  The two
      documents are almost the same, after all; they differ only in
      small, specific ways.</p><p>

      This is the basic concept of a branchânamely,
      a line of development that exists independently of another line,
      yet still shares a common history if you look far enough back in
      time.  A branch always begins life as a copy of something, and
      moves on from there, generating its own history (see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.whatis.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 4.1.Â Branches of development">FigureÂ 4.1, âBranches of developmentâ</a>).</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.branchmerge.whatis.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 4.1.Â Branches of development</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch04dia1.png" alt="Branches of development"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br><p>Subversion has commands to help you maintain parallel
      branches of your files and directories.  It allows you to create
      branches by copying your data, and remembers that the copies are
      related to one another.  It also helps you duplicate changes
      from one branch to another.  Finally, it can make portions of
      your working copy reflect different branches so that you can
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mix and match</span>â</span> different lines of development in
      your daily work.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Using Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.branchmerge.using"></a>Using Branches</h2></div></div></div><p>At this point, you should understand how each commit creates
      a new state of the filesystem tree (called a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revision</span>â</span>)
      in the repository.  If you don't, go back and read about revisions in
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.revs" title="Revisions">the section called âRevisionsâ</a>.</p><p>Let's revisit the example from
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic" title="ChapterÂ 1.Â Fundamental Concepts">ChapterÂ 1, <em>Fundamental Concepts</em></a>.  Remember that you and your
      collaborator, Sally, are sharing a repository that contains two
      projects, <code class="filename">paint</code> and
      <code class="filename">calc</code>.  Notice that in <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 4.2.Â Starting repository layout">FigureÂ 4.2, âStarting repository layoutâ</a>, however, each project
      directory now contains subdirectories named
      <code class="filename">trunk</code> and <code class="filename">branches</code>.
      The reason for this will soon become clear.</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 4.2.Â Starting repository layout</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch04dia2.png" alt="Starting repository layout"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br><p>As before, assume that Sally and you both have working
      copies of the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">calc</span>â</span> project.  Specifically, you
      each have a working copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.
      All the files for the project are in this subdirectory rather
      than in <code class="filename">/calc</code> itself, because your team has
      decided that <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> is where the
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">main line</span>â</span> of development is going to take
      place.</p><p>Let's say that you've been given the task of implementing a
      large software feature.  It will take a long time to write, and
      will affect all the files in the project.  The immediate problem
      is that you don't want to interfere with Sally, who is in the
      process of fixing small bugs here and there.  She's depending on
      the fact that the latest version of the project (in
      <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>) is always usable.  If you
      start committing your changes bit by bit, you'll surely break
      things for Sally (and other team members as well).</p><p>One strategy is to crawl into a hole: you can stop sharing
      information for a week or two, gutting and reorganizing all the
      files in your private working copy but not committing or
      updating until you're completely finished with your task.  There
      are a number of problems with this, though.  First, it's not
      very safe.  Should something bad happen to your working copy or
      computer, you risk losing all your changes.  Second, it's not
      very flexible.  Unless you manually replicate your changes
      across different working copies or computers, you're stuck trying
      to make your changes in a single working copy.  Similarly, it's
      difficult to share your work-in-progress with anyone else.  A
      common software development <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">best practice</span>â</span> is to
      allow your peers to review your work as you go.  If nobody sees
      your intermediate commits, you lose potential feedback and may
      end up going down the wrong path for weeks before another person
      on your team notices.  Finally, when you're finished with all
      your changes, you might find it very difficult to merge your
      completed work with the rest of the company's main body of code.
      Sally (or others) may have made many other changes in the
      repository that are difficult to incorporate into your working
      copy when you eventually run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> after
      weeks of isolation.</p><p>The better solution is to create your own branch, or line of
      development, in the repository.  This allows you to save your
      not-yet-completed work frequently without interfering with
      others' changes and while still selectively sharing information
      with your collaborators.  You'll see exactly how this works as
      we continue.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creating a Branch"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.using.create"></a>Creating a Branch</h3></div></div></div><p>Creating a branch is very simpleâyou make a copy of
        your project tree in the repository using the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        copy</strong></span> command.  Since your project's source code is
        rooted in the <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> directory, it's
        that directory that you'll copy.  Where should the new
        copy live?  Wherever you wish.  The repository location in
        which branches are stashed is left by Subversion as a matter
        of project policy.  Finally, your branch will need a name to
        distinguish it from other branches.  Once again, the name you
        choose is unimportant to Subversionâyou can use whatever
        name works best for you and your team.</p><p>Let's assume that your team (like most) has a policy of
        creating branches in the <code class="filename">branches</code>
        directory that is a sibling of the project's trunk
        (the <code class="filename">/calc/branches</code> directory in our
        scenario).  Lacking inspiration, you settle
        on <code class="literal">my-calc-branch</code> as the name you wish to
        give your branch.  This means that you'll create a new
        directory, <code class="filename">/calc/branches/my-calc-branch</code>,
        which begins its life as a copy
        of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.</p><p>You may already have seen <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> used
        to copy one file to another within a working copy.  But it can
        also be used to do a <em class="firstterm">remote
        copy</em>âa copy that immediately results in a
        newly committed repository revision and for which no working
        copy is required at all.  Just copy one URL to another:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
           -m "Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk."

Committed revision 341.
$
</pre></div><p>This command causes a near-instantaneous commit in the
        repository, creating a new directory in revision 341.  The new
        directory is a copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  This
        is shown in <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 4.3.Â Repository with new copy">FigureÂ 4.3, âRepository with new copyâ</a>.<sup>[<a id="idp36270944" href="#ftn.idp36270944" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup>  While
        it's also possible to create a branch by using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        copy</strong></span> to duplicate a directory within the working
        copy, this technique isn't recommended.  It can be quite slow,
        in fact!  Copying a directory on the client side is a
        linear-time operation, in that it actually has to duplicate
        every file and subdirectory within that working copy directory
        on the local disk.  Copying a directory on the server,
        however, is a constant-time operation, and it's the way most
        people create branches.</p><div class="figure"><a id="svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>FigureÂ 4.3.Â Repository with new copy</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch04dia3.png" alt="Repository with new copy"></img></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"></br><div class="sidebar" title="Cheap Copies"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Cheap Copies</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Subversion's repository has a special design.  When you
          copy a directory, you don't need to worry about the
          repository growing hugeâSubversion doesn't actually
          duplicate any data.  Instead, it creates a new directory
          entry that points to an <span class="emphasis"><em>existing</em></span> tree.
          If you're an experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as
          the same concept behind a hard link.  As further changes are
          made to files and directories beneath the copied directory,
          Subversion continues to employ this hard link concept where
          it can.  It duplicates data only when it is necessary to
          disambiguate different versions of objects.</p><p>This is why you'll often hear Subversion users talk
          about <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">cheap copies.</span>â</span>  It doesn't matter how
          large the directory isâit takes a very tiny, constant
          amount of time and space to make a copy of it.  In fact,
          this feature is the basis of how commits work in Subversion:
          each revision is a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">cheap copy</span>â</span> of the previous
          revision, with a few items lazily changed within.  (To read
          more about this, visit Subversion's web site and read about
          the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">bubble up</span>â</span> method in Subversion's design
          documents.)</p><p>Of course, these internal mechanics of copying and
          sharing data are hidden from the user, who simply sees
          copies of trees.  The main point here is that copies are
          cheap, both in time and in space.  If you create a branch
          entirely within the repository (by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy
          <em class="replaceable"><code>URL1</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>URL2</code></em></code></strong>),
          it's a quick, constant-time operation.  Make branches as
          often as you want.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Working with Your Branch"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.using.work"></a>Working with Your Branch</h3></div></div></div><p>Now that you've created a branch of the project, you can

        mirrors a different directory in the repository.  When you
        commit changes, however, Sally won't see them when she

        <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> show that the two files share a

        from this section.  First, Subversion has no internal concept
        of a branchâit knows only how to make copies.  When you
        copy a directory, the resultant directory is only
        a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">branch</span>â</span> because <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
        attach that meaning to it.  You may think of the directory
        differently, or treat it differently, but to Subversion it's
        just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some extra
        historical information.</p><p>Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's
        branches exist as <span class="emphasis"><em>normal filesystem
        directories</em></span> in the repository.  This is different
        from other version control systems, where branches are
        typically defined by adding
        extra-dimensional <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">labels</span>â</span> to collections of
        files.  The location of your branch directory doesn't matter
        to Subversion.  Most teams follow a convention of putting all
        branches into a <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, but
        you're free to invent any policy you wish.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Basic Merging"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging"></a>Basic Merging</h2></div></div></div><p>Now you and Sally are working on parallel branches of the
      project: you're working on a private branch, and Sally is
      working on the trunk, or main line of development.</p><p>For projects that have a large number of contributors, it's
      common for most people to have working copies of the trunk.
      Whenever someone needs to make a long-running change that is
      likely to disrupt the trunk, a standard procedure is to create a
      private branch and commit changes there until all the work is
      complete.</p><p>So, the good news is that you and Sally aren't interfering
      with each other.  The bad news is that it's very easy to drift
      <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> far apart.  Remember that one of the
      problems with the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">crawl in a hole</span>â</span> strategy is
      that by the time you're finished with your branch, it may be
      near-impossible to merge your changes back into the trunk
      without a huge number of conflicts.</p><p>Instead, you and Sally might continue to share changes as
      you work.  It's up to you to decide which changes are worth
      sharing; Subversion gives you the ability to selectively
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">copy</span>â</span> changes between branches.  And when you're
      completely finished with your branch, your entire set of branch
      changes can be copied back into the trunk.  In Subversion
      terminology, the general act of replicating changes from one
      branch to another is called <em class="firstterm">merging</em>, and
      it is performed using various invocations of the <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> subcommand.</p><p>In the examples that follow, we're assuming that both your
      Subversion client and server are running Subversion 1.7 (or
      later).  If either client or server is older than version 1.5,
      things are more complicated: the system won't track changes
      automatically, forcing you to use painful manual methods to
      achieve similar results.  That is, you'll always need to use the
      detailed merge syntax to specify specific ranges of revisions to
      replicate (see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax" title="Merge Syntax: Full Disclosure">the section called âMerge Syntax:  Full Disclosureâ</a> later
      in this chapter), and take special care to keep track of what's
      already been merged and what hasn't.  For this reason,
      we <span class="emphasis"><em>strongly</em></span> recommend that you make sure your
      client and server are at least at version 1.5.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Merge Tracking"><a id="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergetracking"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Merge Tracking</strong></p></div></div></div><p>
        <a id="idp36327424" class="indexterm"></a>
        Subversion 1.5 introduced the
        <em class="firstterm">merge tracking</em> feature to Subversion.
        Prior to this feature keeping track of merges required cumbersome
        manual procedures or the use of external tools. Subsequent
        releases of Subversion introduced many enhancements and bug
        fixes to merge tracking, which is why we recommend using the
        most recent versions on both your server and client.  Keep in
        mind that even if your server is running 1.5 or 1.6, you can still
        use a 1.7 client.  This is particularly important as regards merge
        tracking, because the overwhelming majority of fixes to it are on
        the client side.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Changesets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.changesets"></a>Changesets</h3></div></div></div><p>Before we proceed further, we should warn you that there's
        a lot of discussion of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">changes</span>â</span> in
        the pages ahead.  A lot of people experienced with version
        control systems use the terms <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">change</span>â</span>
        and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">changeset</span>â</span> interchangeably, and we should
        clarify what Subversion understands as
        a <em class="firstterm">changeset</em>.</p><p>Everyone seems to have a slightly different definition
        of changeset, or at least a different
        expectation of what it means for a version control system to
        have one.  For our purposes, let's say that a changeset is just
        a collection of changes with a unique name.  The changes might
        include textual edits to file contents, modifications to tree
        structure, or tweaks to metadata.  In more common speak, a
        changeset is just a patch with a name you can refer to.</p><p>In Subversion, a global revision
        number <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> names a tree in the
        repository: it's the way the repository looked after the
        <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>th commit.  It's also the name of
        an implicit changeset: if you compare
        tree <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> with
        tree <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em>-1, you can derive the exact
        patch that was committed.  For this reason, it's easy to think
        of revision <em class="replaceable"><code>N</code></em> as not just a tree,
        but a changeset as well.  If you use an issue tracker to
        manage bugs, you can use the revision numbers to refer to
        particular patches that fix bugsâfor example,
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">this issue was fixed by r9238.</span>â</span> Somebody
        can then run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn log -r 9238</code></strong> to read about
        the exact changeset that fixed the bug, and run
        <strong class="userinput"><code>svn diff -c 9238</code></strong> to see the patch itself.
        And (as you'll see shortly)
        Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command is able to use
        revision numbers.  You can merge specific changesets from one
        branch to another by naming them in the merge
        arguments: passing <strong class="userinput"><code>-c 9238</code></strong>
        to <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> would merge changeset r9238
        into your working copy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Keeping a Branch in Sync"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchemerge.basicmerging.stayinsync"></a>Keeping a Branch in Sync</h3></div></div></div><p>Continuing with our running example, let's suppose that a
        week has passed since you started working on your private

        interest to replicate those changes to your own branch, just
        to make sure they mesh well with your changes.  This is done
        by performing a <em class="firstterm">sync merge</em>âa
        merge operation designed to bring your branch up to date with
        any changes made to its ancestral parent branch since your

          Subversion 1.4 or earlier.  In such a scenario, you can of
          course still perform merges, but Subversion will need you to
          manually do many of the historical calculations that it
          automatically does on your behalf when the merge tracking
          feature is available.</p><p>To replicate the most recent trunk changes you need to
          perform sync merges the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">old-fashioned</span>â</span>

          ongoing changes from trunk, you specify the starting
          revision as the revision of <code class="filename">/trunk</code>
          which the branch was copied from and the ending revision as

          the merged changed to your branch.  Now, to avoid
          accidentally trying to merge these same changes into your
          branch again in the future, you'll need to record the fact
          that you've already merged them.  But where should that
          record be kept?  One of the simplest places to record this
          information is in the log message for the commit of the
          merge:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          the starting revision is the <span class="emphasis"><em>youngest</em></span>
          revision that's already been merged in from the trunk.
          If you've been keeping good records of your merges in the
          commit log messages, you should be able to determine what
          that youngest revision was by reading the revision logs
          associated with your branch.  Once you know your starting
          revision, you can perform another sync merge:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/trunk -r556:HEAD
â¦
</pre></div></div><p>After running the prior example, your branch working copy
        now contains new local modifications, and these edits are
        duplications of all of the changes that have happened on the
        trunk since you first created your branch:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status

</pre></div><p>At this point, the wise thing to do is look at the changes
        carefully with <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, and then build and
        test your branch.  Notice that the current working directory
        (<span class="quote">â<span class="quote"><code class="filename">.</code></span>â</span>) has also been
        modified; <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> will show that
        its <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property has been either
        created or modified.  This is important merge-related metadata
        that you should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> touch, since it is
        needed by future <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> commands.
        (We'll learn more about this metadata later in the
        chapter.)</p><p>After performing the merge, you might also need to resolve
        some conflictsâjust as you do with <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span>âor possibly make some small edits to get
        things working properly.  (Remember, just because there are
        no <span class="emphasis"><em>syntactic</em></span> conflicts doesn't mean there
        aren't any <span class="emphasis"><em>semantic</em></span> conflicts!)  If you
        encounter serious problems, you can always abort the local
        changes by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn revert . -R</code></strong> (which
        will undo all local modifications) and starting a
        long <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">what's going on?</span>â</span> discussion with your
        collaborators.  If things look good, however, you can

          Unix user: why bother to use <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> at
          all?  Why not simply use <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span> or the
          operating system's <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> command to
          accomplish the same job?  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn diff -r 341:HEAD ^/calc/trunk &gt; my-patch-file
$ svn patch my-patch-file
U         integer.c
$
</pre></div><p>In this particular example, there really isn't much
          difference.  But <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> has special
          abilities that surpass the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program.
          The file format used by <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> is quite
          limited; it's able to tweak file contents only.  There's no
          way to represent changes to <span class="emphasis"><em>trees</em></span>, such
          as the addition, removal, or renaming of files and
          directories.  Nor can the <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program
          notice changes to properties.  If Sally's change had,
          say, added a new directory, the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
          diff</strong></span> wouldn't have mentioned it at
          all.  <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> outputs only the limited
          patch format, so there are some ideas it simply can't
          express.  Even Subversion's own <span class="command"><strong>svn patch</strong></span>
          subcommand, while more flexible than patch program, still has
          similar limitations.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command, however, can
          express changes in tree structure and properties by directly
          applying them to your working copy.  Even more important,
          this command records the changes that have been duplicated
          to your branch so that Subversion is aware of exactly which
          changes exist in each location (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo" title="Mergeinfo and Previews">the section called âMergeinfo and Previewsâ</a>).
          This is a critical feature that makes branch management
          usable; without it, users would have to manually keep notes
          on which sets of changes have or haven't been merged
          yet.</p></div><p>Suppose that another week has passed.  You've committed
        more changes to your branch, and your comrades have continued
        to improve the trunk as well.  Once again, you want to
        replicate the latest trunk changes to your branch and bring
        yourself in sync.  Just run the same merge command
        again!</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/calc/trunk

</pre></div><p>Well that was unexpected!  After making changes to your
        branch over the past week you now find yourself with a working
        copy that contains a mixture of revisions (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs" title="Mixed-revision working copies">the section called âMixed-revision working copiesâ</a>).  With the
        release of Subversion 1.7 the <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        subcommand disables merges into mixed-revision working copies
        by default.  Without going into too much detail, this is
        because of limitations in the way merges are tracked by the
        <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo" title="Mergeinfo and Previews">the section called âMergeinfo and Previewsâ</a> for
        details).  These limitations mean that merges into
        mixed-revision working copies can result in unexpected text
        and tree conflicts.<sup>[<a id="idp36406880" href="#ftn.idp36406880" class="footnote">27</a>]</sup>  We don't want any needless conflicts, so

          In most of the examples in this chapter the merge target is
          the root directory of a branch (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.whatis" title="What's a Branch?">the section called âWhat's a Branch?â</a>). While this is a
          best practice, you may occasionally need to merge directly to
          some child of the branch root. This type of merge is called a
          <em class="firstterm">subtree merge</em> and the mergeinfo recorded
          to describe it is called
          <em class="firstterm">subtree mergeinfo</em>. There is nothing
          special about subtree merges or subtree mergeinfo.  In fact
          there is really only one important point to keep in mind
          about these concepts: the complete record of merges to a
          branch may not be contained solely in the mergeinfo on the
          branch root.  You may have to look to any subtree mergeinfo
          to get a full accounting.  Fortunately Subversion does this
          for you and rarely will you need to concern yourself with
          it.  A brief example will help explain:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

  svn:mergeinfo

# Now we perform the subtree merge, note that merge source

  svn:mergeinfo
    /trunk/doc/INSTALL:651-652,958

# What if we then decide we do want all of r958? Easy, all we need do is
# repeat the merge of that revision, but this time to the root of the

          in the above example has mergeinfo for r651-652, when we

          <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the subtree mergeinfo under the

          mergeinfo this meant that relatively <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">simple</span>â</span>
          merges (e.g. one which applied a diff to only a single file)
          resulted in changes to every subtree with mergeinfo, even
          those that were not parents of the effected path(s). This
          caused some level of confusion and frustration. Subversion 1.7
          addresses this problem by only updating the mergeinfo on
          subtrees which are parents of the paths modified by the merge
          (i.e. paths changed, added, or deleted by application of the

</pre></div><p>Congratulations, your branch-specific changes have now
        been merged back into the main line of development.  Notice
        our use of the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option this time
        around.  The option is critical for reintegrating changes from
        a branch back into its original line of
        developmentâdon't forget it!  It's needed because this
        sort of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">merge back</span>â</span> is a different sort of work
        than what you've done up until now.  Previously, we were
        asking <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to grab the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">next
        set</span>â</span> of changes from one line of development (the
        trunk) and duplicate them to another (your branch).  This is
        fairly straightforward, and each time Subversion knows how to
        pick up where it left off.  In our prior examples, you can see
        that first it merges the ranges 345:356 from trunk to branch;
        later on, it continues by merging the next contiguously
        available range, 356:380.  When doing the final sync, it
        merges the range 380:385.</p><p>When merging your branch back to the trunk, however, the
        underlying mathematics are quite different.  Your feature
        branch is now a mishmash of both duplicated trunk changes and
        private branch changes, so there's no simple contiguous range
        of revisions to copy over.  By specifying
        the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option, you're asking
        Subversion to carefully replicate <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
        those changes unique to your branch.  (And in fact, it does
        this by comparing the latest trunk tree with the latest branch
        tree:  the resulting difference is exactly your branch
        changes!)</p><p>Keep in mind that the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code>
        option is quite specialized in contrast to the more general
        nature of most Subversion subcommand options.  It supports the
        use case described above, but has little applicability outside
        of that.  Because of this narrow focus, in addition to
        requiring an up-to-date working copy<sup>[<a id="idp36449200" href="#ftn.idp36449200" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup> with no mixed-revisions,
        it will not function in combination with most of the other
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> options. You'll get an error if you
        use any non-global options but these: <code class="option">--accept</code>,
        <code class="option">--dry-run</code>, <code class="option">--diff3-cmd</code>,
        <code class="option">--extensions</code>, or <code class="option">--quiet</code>.</p><p>Now that your private branch is merged to trunk, you may
        wish to remove it from the repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        What if somebody wants to audit the evolution of your feature
        someday and look at all of your branch changes?  No need to
        worry.  Remember that even though your branch is no longer
        visible in the <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, its
        existence is still an immutable part of the repository's
        history.  A simple <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command on
        the <code class="filename">/branches</code> URL will show the entire
        history of your branch.  Your branch can even be resurrected
        at some point, should you desire (see

        branch to trunk, the branch is no longer usable for further
        work.  It's not able to correctly absorb new trunk changes,
        nor can it be properly reintegrated to trunk again.  For this
        reason, if you want to keep working on your feature branch, we
        recommend destroying it and then re-creating it from the
        trunk:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        changesetsâthat is, which changes have been merged to
        which branchesâis by recording data in versioned
        properties.  Specifically, merge data is tracked in
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property attached to
        files and directories.  (If you're not familiar with
        Subversion properties, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props" title="Properties">the section called âPropertiesâ</a>.)</p><p>You can examine the property, just like any other:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          modify <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> just as you might

          <span class="command"><strong>svn proplist --recursive</strong></span> when dealing with
          large amounts of subtree mergeinfo, see

          . The formatted output produced by the
          <code class="option">--verbose</code> option with either of these
          subcommands is often very helpful in these cases.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>The <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property is
        automatically maintained by Subversion whenever you
        run <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>.  Its value indicates which
        changes made to a given path have been replicated into the
        directory in question.  In our previous example, the path
        which is the source of the merged changes is
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code> and the directory which has
        received the changes is
        <code class="filename">/branches/my-calc-branch</code>.
        Earlier versions of Subversion maintained the
        <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property silently. You could
        still detect the changes, after a merge completed, with the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>
        subcommands, but the merge itself gave no indication when it
        changed the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property. This is no
        longer true in Subversion 1.7, which has several new notifications
        to alert you when a merge updates the
        <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property. These notifications
        all begin with <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">--- Recording mergeinfo for</span>â</span>
        and appear at the end of the merge.  Unlike other merge
        notifications, these don't describe the application of a
        difference to a working copy
        (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax" title="Merge Syntax: Full Disclosure">the section called âMerge Syntax:  Full Disclosureâ</a>),
        but instead describe "housekeeping" changes made to keep
        track of what was merged.</p><p>Subversion also provides a subcommand, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        mergeinfo</strong></span>, which is helpful in seeing not only
        which changesets a directory has absorbed, but also which
        changesets it's still eligible to receive.  This gives a sort
        of preview of which changes a subsequent <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> operation would replicate to your
        branch.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        the changes merge to).  If no target URL is given,
        it assumes that the current working directory is the
        target.  In the prior example, because we're querying our
        branch working copy, the command assumes we're interested in
        receiving changes to <code class="filename">/branches/mybranch</code>

          not only what changes were merged into that particular
          directory, but also all the children of that directory
          (because those children inherit the mergeinfo of their
          parent path).  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

# Ask what revs were merged to a file with no explicit mergeinfo

</pre></div><p>Notice from our first subcommand that only the root of
          <code class="filename">/branches/proj-X</code> has any explicit
          mergeinfo.  However, when we use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn mergeinfo</strong></span> to ask what was merged to
          <code class="filename">/branches/proj-X/src/main.c</code> it reports
          that the two revisions described in the explicit mergeinfo
          on <code class="filename">/branches/proj-X</code> were merged.  This is
          because <code class="filename">/branches/proj-X/src/main.c</code>, having
          no explicit mergeinfo of its own, inherits the mergeinfo from
          its nearest parent with explicit mergeinfo,
          <code class="filename">/branches/proj-X</code>.</p><p>There are two cases in which mergeinfo is not inherited.
          First, if a path has explicit mergeinfo, then it never inherits
          mergeinfo. Another way to think of this is that explicit
          mergeinfo is always a complete record of the merges to a given
          path, once it exists it overrides any mergeinfo that path might
          otherwise inherit. The second way is when dealing with
          non-inheritable mergeinfo, a special type of explicit mergeinfo
          that applies <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> to the directory on which
          the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property is set (and it's
          only directories, non-inheritable mergeinfo is never set on
          files). For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
# The '*' decorator indicates non-inheritable mergeinfo
$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo ^/branches/proj-X
/trunk:651-652,758*

# Revision 758 is non-inheritable, but still applies to the path it is
# set on. Here the '*' decorator signals that r758 is only partially
# merged from trunk. 
$ svn mergeinfo ^/trunk ^/branches/proj-X
651
652
758*

# Revision 758 is not reported as merged because it is non-inheritable
# and applies only to ^/trunk
$ svn mergeinfo ^/trunk/src/main.c ^/branches/proj-X/src/main.c
651
652
</pre></div><p>You might never have to think about mergeinfo inheritance
          or encounter non-inheritable mergeinfo in your own repository.
          A discussion of the full ramifications of mergeinfo inheritance
          are beyond the scope of this book.  If you have more questions
          check out some of the references mentioned in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.advanced.finalword" title="The Final Word on Merge Tracking">the section called âThe Final Word on Merge Trackingâ</a></p></div><p>With the release of Subversion 1.7, the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn mergeinfo</strong></span> subcommand can also account for
        subtree mergeinfo and non-inheritable mergeinfo.  It accounts for
        subtree mergeinfo by use of the <code class="option">--recursive</code> or
        <code class="option">--depth</code> options, while non-inheritable mergeinfo
        is considered by default.</p><p>Let's say we have a branch with both subtree and
        non-inheritable mergeinfo:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo --recursive -v
# Non-inheritable mergeinfo

Properties on 'doc/INSTALL':
  svn:mergeinfo
    /trunk/doc/INSTALL:651-652,958,1060
</pre></div><p>From the above mergeinfo we see that r758 has only been
        merged into the root of the branch, but not any of the root's
        children.  We also see that both r958 and r1060 have been
        merged only to the <code class="filename">doc/INSTALL</code> file.
        When we use <span class="command"><strong>svn mergeinfo</strong></span> with the
        <code class="option">--recursive</code> option to see what has been merged
        from <code class="filename">^/trunk</code> to this branch, we see two
        revisions are flagged with the <code class="literal">*</code> marker:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        <span class="emphasis"><em>partially</em></span> merged to the target in question
        (the meaning is the same if we are checking for eligible
        revisions).  What this means in this example is that if we tried
        to merge r758 or r958 from <code class="filename">^/trunk</code> then more
        changes would result. Likewise, because r1060 is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> flagged with a <code class="literal">*</code>,
        we know that it only affects <code class="filename">doc/INSTALL</code>
        and that trying to merge it would have no result.<sup>[<a id="idp36529200" href="#ftn.idp36529200" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup></p><p>Another way to get a more precise preview of a merge
        operation is to use the <code class="option">--dry-run</code>

        apply any local changes to the working copy.  It shows only
        status codes that <span class="emphasis"><em>would</em></span> be printed in a
        real merge.  It's useful for getting a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">high-level</span>â</span>
        preview of the potential merge, for those times

        modifications to your working copyâbut we already
        stressed that you shouldn't merge into such an
        environment).  If you don't like the results of the merge,
        simply run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn revert . -R</code></strong> to revert
        the changes from your working copy and retry the command with

        is to roll back a change that has already been committed.
        Suppose you're working away happily on a working copy of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, and you discover that the
        change made way back in revision 303, which changed
        <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, is completely wrong.  It never

        working copy, and then commit the local modification to the
        repository.  All you need to do is to specify a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>reverse</em></span> difference.  (You can do this by
        specifying <code class="option">--revision 303:302</code>, or by an

</pre></div><p>As we mentioned earlier, one way to think about a
        repository revision is as a specific changeset.  By using the
        <code class="option">-r</code> option, you can ask <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> to apply a changeset, or a whole range of
        changesets, to your working copy.  In our case of undoing a
        change, we're asking <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to apply
        changeset r303 to our working copy
        <span class="emphasis"><em>backward</em></span>.</p><p>Keep in mind that rolling back a change like this is just
        like any other <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> operation, so you
        should use <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span> to confirm that your work is in the state you
        want it to be in, and then use <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>
        to send the final version to the repository.  After
        committing, this particular changeset is no longer reflected
        in the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.</p><p>Again, you may be thinking: well, that really didn't undo
        the commit, did it?  The change still exists in revision 303.
        If somebody checks out a version of the
        <code class="filename">calc</code> project between revisions 303 and
        349, she'll still see the bad change, right?</p><p>Yes, that's true.  When we talk about
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">removing</span>â</span> a change, we're really talking about
        removing it from the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.  The
        original change still exists in the repository's history.  For
        most situations, this is good enough.  Most people are only
        interested in tracking the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> of a
        project anyway.  There are special cases, however, where you
        really might want to destroy all evidence of the commit.
        (Perhaps somebody accidentally committed a confidential
        document.)  This isn't so easy, it turns out, because
        Subversion was deliberately designed to never lose
        information.  Revisions are immutable trees that build upon
        one another.  Removing a revision from history would cause a
        domino effect, creating chaos in all subsequent revisions and
        possibly invalidating all working copies.<sup>[<a id="idp36561568" href="#ftn.idp36561568" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Resurrecting Deleted Items"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.resurrect"></a>Resurrecting Deleted Items</h3></div></div></div><p>The great thing about version control systems is that
        information is never lost.  Even when you delete a file or
        directory, it may be gone from the <code class="literal">HEAD</code>
        revision, but the object still exists in earlier revisions.
        One of the most common questions new users ask is, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">How
        do I get my old file or directory back?</span>â</span></p><p>The first step is to define
        exactly <span class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> item you're
        trying to resurrect.  Here's a useful metaphor: you can think
        of every object in the repository as existing in a sort of
        two-dimensional coordinate system.  The first coordinate is a
        particular revision tree, and the second coordinate is a path
        within that tree.  So every version of your file or directory
        is defined by a specific coordinate pair.  (Remember the
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">peg revision</span>â</span>
        syntaxâfoo.c@224âmentioned back in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.pegrevs" title="Peg and Operative Revisions">the section called âPeg and Operative Revisionsâ</a>.)</p><p>First, you might need to use <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> to
        discover the exact coordinate pair you wish to resurrect.  A
        good strategy is to run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn log --verbose</code></strong>
        in a directory that used to contain your deleted item.  The
        <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option shows
        a list of all changed items in each revision; all you need to
        do is find the revision in which you deleted the file or
        directory.  You can do this visually, or by using another tool
        to examine the log output (via <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span>, or
        perhaps via an incremental search in an editor).</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        addition, and after a commit, the file would again exist
        in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.</p><p>In this particular example, however, this is probably not
        the best strategy.  Reverse-applying revision 808 would not
        only schedule <code class="filename">real.c</code> for addition, but
        the log message indicates that it would also undo certain
        changes to <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, which you don't
        want.  Certainly, you could reverse-merge revision 808 and
        then <span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> the local modifications to
        <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, but this technique doesn't
        scale well.  What if 90 files were changed in revision
        808?</p><p>A second, more targeted strategy is not to use
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> at all, but rather to use the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> command.  Simply copy the exact
        revision and path <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">coordinate pair</span>â</span> from the
        repository to your working copy:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy ^/calc/trunk/real.c@807 ./real.c

</pre></div><p>The plus sign in the status output indicates that the item
        isn't merely scheduled for addition, but scheduled for
        addition <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">with history.</span>â</span>  Subversion remembers
        where it was copied from.  In the future, running <span class="command"><strong>svn
        log</strong></span> on this file will traverse back through the
        file's resurrection and through all the history it had prior
        to revision 807.  In other words, this new
        <code class="filename">real.c</code> isn't really new; it's a direct
        descendant of the original, deleted file.  This is usually
        considered a good and useful thing.  If, however, you wanted
        to resurrect the file <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span>
        maintaining a historical link to the old file, this technique
        works just as well:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        that these same techniques work just as well for resurrecting
        deleted directories.  Also note that a resurrection doesn't
        have to happen in your working copyâit can happen
        entirely in the repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

      get the hang of branching and merging, you're going to have to
      ask Subversion to merge <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> changes
      from one place to another.  To do this, you're going to
      have to start passing more complicated arguments to <span class="command"><strong>svn

      syntax of the command and discusses a number of common
      scenarios that require it.</p><div class="sect2" title="Cherrypicking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.cherrypicking"></a>Cherrypicking</h3></div></div></div><p>Just as the term <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">changeset</span>â</span> is often used in
        version control systems, so is the term
        <em class="firstterm">cherrypicking</em>.  This word refers to
        the act of choosing <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> specific
        changeset from a branch and replicating it to another.
        Cherrypicking may also refer to the act of duplicating a
        particular set of (not necessarily contiguous!) changesets
        from one branch to another.  This is in contrast to more
        typical merging scenarios, where the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">next</span>â</span>
        contiguous range of revisions is duplicated
        automatically.</p><p>Why would people want to replicate just a single change?
        It comes up more often than you'd think.  For example, let's
        go back in time and imagine that you haven't yet merged your
        private feature branch back to the trunk.  At the
        water cooler, you get word that Sally made an interesting
        change to <code class="filename">integer.c</code> on the trunk.
        Looking over the history of commits to the trunk, you see that
        in revision 355 she fixed a critical bug that directly
        impacts the feature you're working on.  You might not be ready
        to merge all the trunk changes to your branch just yet, but
        you certainly need that particular bug fix in order to continue
        your work.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          changeset 355, which your branch already contained.  There's
          nothing inherently wrong with this, except that it has the
          potential to make conflict resolution trickier.  If the

        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> are very similar in concept, they
        do have different syntax in many cases.  Be sure to read about
        them in <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a> for details, or ask
        <span class="command"><strong>svn help</strong></span>.  For example, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> requires a working copy path as a target, that is,
        a place where it should apply the generated patch.  If the
        target isn't specified, it assumes you are trying to perform
        one of the following common operations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>You want to merge directory changes into your current

        target path, <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> assumes the first
        case and tries to apply the changes into your current

        file by the same name) exists in your current working
        directory,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> assumes the second case and tries
        to apply the changes to a local file with the same name.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Merge Syntax: Full Disclosure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax"></a>Merge Syntax:  Full Disclosure</h3></div></div></div><p>You've now seen some examples of the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> command, and you're about to see several more.
        If you're feeling confused about exactly how merging works,
        you're not alone.  Many users (especially those new to version
        control) are initially perplexed about the proper syntax of
        the command and about how and when the feature should be
        used.  But fear not, this command is actually much simpler
        than you think!  There's a very easy technique for
        understanding exactly how <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        behaves.</p><p>The main source of confusion is the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> of the command.  The term
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">merge</span>â</span> somehow denotes that branches are
        combined together, or that some sort of mysterious
        blending of data is going on.  That's not the case.  A better
        name for the command might have been <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff-and-apply</strong></span>, because that's all that happens:
        two repository trees are compared, and the differences are
        applied to a working copy.</p><p>If you're using <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to do basic
        copying of changes between branches, it will generally do the
        right thing automatically.  For example, a command such as the
        following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge ^/calc/branches/some-branch
</pre></div><p>will attempt to duplicate any changes made
        on <code class="filename">some-branch</code> into your current working
        directory, which is presumably a working copy that shares some
        historical connection to the branch.  The command is smart
        enough to only duplicate changes that your working copy
        doesn't yet have.  If you repeat this command once a week, it
        will only duplicate the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">newest</span>â</span> branch changes
        that happened since you last merged.</p><p>If you choose to use the <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        command in all its full glory by giving it specific revision
        ranges to duplicate, the command takes three main
        arguments:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>An initial repository tree (often called the
            <em class="firstterm">left side</em> of the comparison)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A final repository tree (often called the
            <em class="firstterm">right side</em> of the
            comparison)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A working copy to accept the differences as local
            changes (often called the <em class="firstterm">target</em> of
            the merge)</p></li></ol></div><p>Once these three arguments are specified, then the two trees
        are compared and the differences applied to the
        target working copy as local modifications.  When the command
        is done, the results are no different than if you had
        hand-edited the files or run various <span class="command"><strong>svn
        add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> commands
        yourself.  If you like the results, you can commit them.  If
        you don't like the results, you can simply <span class="command"><strong>svn
        revert</strong></span> all of the changes.</p><p>The syntax of <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> allows you to
        specify the three necessary arguments rather flexibly.  Here
        are some examples:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/branch1@150 \
            http://svn.example.com/repos/branch2@212 \
            my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk
</pre></div><p>The first syntax lays out all three arguments explicitly,
        naming each tree in the form <span class="emphasis"><em>URL@REV</em></span> and
        naming the working copy target.  The second syntax is used
        as a shorthand for situations when you're comparing two
        different revisions of the same URL.  The last syntax shows
        how the working copy argument is optional; if omitted, it
        defaults to the current directory.</p><p>While the first example shows the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">full</span>â</span>
        syntax of <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>, use it
        very carefully;  it can result in merges which do not record
        any <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> metadata at all.  The
        next section talks a bit more about this.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Merges Without Mergeinfo"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.nomergedata"></a>Merges Without Mergeinfo</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion tries to generate merge metadata whenever it
        can, to make future invocations of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> smarter.  There are still situations, however,
        where <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> data is not created or
        changed.  Remember to be a bit wary of these scenarios:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Merging unrelated sources</span></dt><dd><p>If you ask <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare
              two URLs that aren't related to each other, a patch is
              still generated and applied to your working copy, but
              no merging metadata is created.  There's no common
              history between the two sources, and
              future <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">smart</span>â</span> merges depend on that common
              history.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Merging from foreign repositories</span></dt><dd><p>While it's possible to run a command such
              as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn merge -r 100:200
              <em class="replaceable"><code>http://svn.foreignproject.com/repos/trunk</code></em></code></strong>,
              the resultant patch also lacks any historical merge
              metadata.  At the time of this writing, Subversion has no
              way of representing different repository URLs within

              chapter in

              using <strong class="userinput"><code>svn merge . -c -5</code></strong>), this
              sort of merge doesn't affect the recorded
              mergeinfo.<sup>[<a id="idp36673408" href="#ftn.idp36673408" class="footnote">33</a>]</sup></p></dd></dl></div><div class="sidebar" title="Natural History and Implicit Mergeinfo"><a id="svn.branchmerge.nomergedata.impicit.mergeinfo"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Natural History and Implicit Mergeinfo</strong></p></div></div></div><p>As we mentioned earlier when discussing
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo.inheritance" title="Mergeinfo Inheritance">Mergeinfo Inheritance</a>,
          a path that has the
          <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property set on it is said to
          have <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">explicit</span>â</span> mergeinfo.  Yes, this implies a
          path can have <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">implicit</span>â</span> mergeinfo, too!  Implicit
          mergeinfo, or <em class="firstterm">natural history</em>, is
          simply a path's own history (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.history" title="Examining History">the section called âExamining Historyâ</a>) interpreted as mergeinfo.
          While implicit mergeinfo is largely
          an implementation detail, it can be a useful abstraction for
          understanding merge tracking behavior.</p><p>Let's say you created <code class="filename">^/trunk</code> in
          revision 100 and then later, in revision 201,
          created <code class="filename">^/branches/feature-branch</code> as
          a copy of <code class="filename">^/trunk@200</code>.  The natural
          history of <code class="filename">^/branches/feature-branch</code>
          contains all the repository paths and revision ranges
          through which the history of the new branch has ever
          passed:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/trunk:100-200<br></br>
/branches/feature-branch:201<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>With each new revision added to the repository, the
          natural historyâand thus, implicit mergeinfoâof
          the branch continues to expand to include those revisions
          until the day the branch is deleted.  Here's what the
          implicit mergeinfo of our branch would look like when
          the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision of the repository had
          grown to 234:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/trunk:100-200<br></br>
/branches/feature-branch:201-234<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>Implicit mergeinfo does not actually show up in the
          <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property, but Subversion
          acts as if it does.  This is why if you check out
          <code class="filename">^/branches/feature-branch</code> and then
          run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn merge ^/trunk -c 58</code></strong> in the
          resulting working copy, nothing happens.  Subversion knows
          that the changes committed to <code class="filename">^/trunk</code>
          in revision 58 are already present in the target's natural
          history, so there's no need to try to merge them again.
          After all, avoiding repeated merges of
          changes <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the primary goal of
          Subversion's merge tracking feature!</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="More on Merge Conflicts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.mergeconflicts"></a>More on Merge Conflicts</h3></div></div></div><p>Just like the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> applies changes to your working
        copy.  And therefore it's also capable of creating
        conflicts.  The conflicts produced by <span class="command"><strong>svn
          merge</strong></span>, however, are sometimes different, and this
        section explains those differences.</p><p>To begin with, assume that your working copy has no
        local edits.  When you <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to a
        particular revision, the changes sent by the server
        always apply <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">cleanly</span>â</span> to your working copy.
        The server produces the delta by comparing two trees: a
        virtual snapshot of your working copy, and the revision tree
        you're interested in.  Because the left hand side of the
        comparison is exactly equal to what you already have, the
        delta is guaranteed to correctly convert your working copy
        into the right hand tree.</p><p>But <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> has no such guarantees
        and can be much more chaotic: the advanced user can ask the
        server to compare <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> two trees at all,
        even ones that are unrelated to the working copy!  This means
        there's large potential for human error.  Users will sometimes
        compare the wrong two trees, creating a delta that doesn't
        apply cleanly. The <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> subcommand does
        its best to apply as much of the delta as possible, but some
        parts may be impossible. A common sign that you merged the wrong
        delta is unexpected tree conflicts:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn merge -r 1288:1351 http://svn.example.com/myrepos/branch

      &gt;   local missing, incoming edit upon merge
!     C docs
      &gt;   local delete, incoming edit upon merge
</pre></div><p>In the previous example, it might be the case that
        <code class="filename">bar.c</code>, <code class="filename">foo.c</code>, and
        <code class="filename">docs</code> all exist in both snapshots of the
        branch being compared.  The resultant delta wants to change
        the contents of the corresponding paths in your working copy,
        but those paths don't exist in the working copy.  Whatever the
        case, the preponderance of tree conflicts most likely means that
        the user compared the wrong two trees; it's a classic
        sign of user error.  When this happens, it's easy to
        recursively revert all the changes created by the merge
        (<strong class="userinput"><code>svn revert . --recursive</code></strong>), delete any
        unversioned files or directories left behind after the
        revert, and rerun <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> with the
        correct arguments.</p><p>Also keep in mind that a merge into a working copy with no
        local edits can still produce text conflicts.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>How can a conflict possibly happen?  Again, because the user
        can request <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to define and apply any
        old delta to the working copy, that delta may contain textual
        changes that don't cleanly apply to a working file, even if
        the file has no local modifications.</p><p>Another small difference between <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> is the names
        of the full-text files created when a conflict happens.  In
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="Resolve Any Conflicts">the section called âResolve Any Conflictsâ</a>, we saw that an
        update produces files named
        <code class="filename">filename.mine</code>,
        <code class="filename">filename.rOLDREV</code>, and
        <code class="filename">filename.rNEWREV</code>.  When <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> produces a conflict, though, it creates three
        files named <code class="filename">filename.working</code>,
        <code class="filename">filename.merge-left.rOLDREV</code>, and
        <code class="filename">filename.merge-right.rNEWREV</code>.  In this case,
        the terms <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">merge-left</span>â</span> and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">merge-right</span>â</span>
        are describing which side of the double-tree comparison the file
        came from, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">rOLDREV</span>â</span> describes the revision of the
        left side, and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">rNEWREV</span>â</span> the revision of the right
        side. In any case, these differing names help you distinguish
        between conflicts that happened as a result of an  update and
        ones that happened as a result of a merge.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Blocking Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.blockchanges"></a>Blocking Changes</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes there's a particular changeset that you don't
        want automatically merged.  For example, perhaps your
        team's policy is to do new development work on
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code>, but is more conservative about
        backporting changes to a stable branch you use for releasing
        to the public.  On one extreme, you can manually cherrypick
        single changesets from the trunk to the branchâjust the
        changes that are stable enough to pass muster.  Maybe things
        aren't quite that strict, though; perhaps most of the time
        you just let <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>
        automatically merge most changes from trunk to branch.  In
        this case, you want a way to mask a few specific changes
        out, that is, prevent them from ever being automatically
        merged.</p><p>Through Subversion 1.7, the only way to block a changeset
        is to make the system believe that the change has
        <span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> been merged.  To do this, invoke
        the merge subcommand with the <code class="option">--record-only</code>
        option:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305

# Let's make the metadata list r3328 as already merged.
$ svn merge -c 3328 --record-only ^/calc/trunk

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305,3328

$ svn commit -m "Block r3328 from being merged to the branch."
â¦
</pre></div><p>Beginning with Subversion 1.7, <code class="option">--record-only</code>
        merges are transitive.  This means that, in addition to recording
        mergeinfo describing the blocked revision(s), any
        <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property differences in the
        merge source are also applied.  For example, let's say we want to
        block the 'frazzle' feature from ever being merged from
        <code class="filename">^/trunk</code> to our
        <code class="filename">^/branches/proj-X</code> branch.  We know that all
        the frazzle work was done on its own branch, which was
        reintegrated to <code class="filename">trunk</code> in revision 1055:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        works, but it's also a little bit

        merged.  This puts the responsibility on youâthe
        userâto remember that the change wasn't actually merged,
        it just wasn't wanted.  There's no way to ask Subversion for a
        list of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">blocked changelists.</span>â</span> If you want to
        track them (so that you can unblock them someday) you'll need
        to record them in a text file somewhere, or perhaps in an
        invented property.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Keeping a Reintegrated Branch Alive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.reintegratetwice"></a>Keeping a Reintegrated Branch Alive</h3></div></div></div><p>There is an alternative to destroying and re-creating a
        branch after reintegration. To understand why it works you need
        to understand why the branch is initially unfit for further use
        after it has been reintegrated.</p><p>Let's assume you created your branch in revision
        <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span>. While working on your branch, you created
        one or more revisions which made changes to the branch.
        Before reintegrating your branch back to trunk, you made a final
        merge from trunk to your branch, and committed the result of
        this merge as revision <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>.</p><p>When reintegrating your branch into the trunk, you create
        a new revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> which changes the trunk.
        The changes made to trunk in this revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
        are semantically equivalent to the changes you made to your branch
        between revisions <span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>B</em></span>.</p><p>If you now try to merge outstanding changes from trunk to your
        branch, Subversion will consider changes made in revision
        <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> as eligible for merging into the
        branch. However, since your branch already contains all the
        changes made in revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, merging these
        changes can result in spurious conflicts! These conflicts are
        often tree conflicts, especially if renames were made on the
        branch or the trunk while the branch was in development.</p><p>So what can be done about this? We need to make sure that
        Subversion does not try to merge revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
        into the branch. This is done using the
        <code class="option">--record-only</code> merge option, which was introduced
        in <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.advanced.blockchanges" title="Blocking Changes">the section called âBlocking Changesâ</a>.</p><p>To carry out the record-only merge, get a working copy of
        the branch which was just reintegrated in revision
        <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, and merge just revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
        from trunk into your branch, making sure to use the
        <code class="option">--record-only</code> option.</p><p>This merge uses the cherry-picking merge syntax, which was
        introduced in <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.cherrypicking" title="Cherrypicking">the section called âCherrypickingâ</a>.
        Continuing with the running example from
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchemerge.basicmerging.reintegrate" title="Reintegrating a Branch">the section called âReintegrating a Branchâ</a>,
        where revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> was revision 391:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn update

Updated to revision 393.

 U   .
$ svn commit -m "Block revision 391 from being merged into my-calc-branch."
Sending        .

Committed revision 394.
</pre></div><p>Now your branch is ready to soak up changes from the trunk
        again. After another sync of your branch to the trunk, you can
        even reintegrate the branch a second time.
        If necessary, you can do another record-only merge to keep the
        branch alive. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>It should now also be apparent why deleting the branch and
        re-creating it has the same effect as doing the above record-only
        merge. Because revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is part of the natural
        history (see the sidebar
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.nomergedata.impicit.mergeinfo" title="Natural History and Implicit Mergeinfo">Natural History and Implicit Mergeinfo</a>)
        of the newly created branch, Subversion will never attempt to
        merge revision <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> into the branch, avoiding
        spurious conflicts.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Merge-Sensitive Logs and Annotations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.logblame"></a>Merge-Sensitive Logs and Annotations</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the main features of any version control system is
        to keep track of who changed what, and when they did it.
        The <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        blame</strong></span> subcommands are just the tools for this: when
        invoked on individual files, they show not only the history of
        changesets that affected the file, but also exactly which user
        wrote which line of code, and when she did it.</p><p>When changes start getting replicated between branches,
        however, things start to get complicated.  For example, if you
        were to ask <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> about the history of
        your feature branch, it would show exactly every revision that ever

        When conversing with a Subversion developer, you might

        <em class="firstterm">ancestry</em>.  This word is used to
        describe the relationship between two objects in a
        repository: if they're related to each other, one
        object is said to be an ancestor of the other.</p><p>For example, suppose you commit revision 100, which
        includes a change to a file <code class="filename">foo.c</code>.
        Then <code class="filename">foo.c@99</code> is an
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">ancestor</span>â</span> of <code class="filename">foo.c@100</code>.
        On the other hand, suppose you commit the deletion of
        <code class="filename">foo.c</code> in revision 101, and then add a
        new file by the same name in revision 102.  In this case,
        <code class="filename">foo.c@99</code> and
        <code class="filename">foo.c@102</code> may appear to be related
        (they have the same path), but in fact are completely
        different objects in the repository.  They share no history
        or <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">ancestry.</span>â</span></p><p>The reason for bringing this up is to point out an
        important difference between <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span>.  The former command ignores
        ancestry, while the latter command is quite sensitive to it.
        For example, if you asked <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to
        compare revisions 99 and 102 of <code class="filename">foo.c</code>,
        you would see line-based diffs; the <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span>
        command is blindly comparing two paths.  But if you asked
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare the same two objects,
        it would notice that they're unrelated and first attempt to
        delete the old file, then add the new file;  the output would
        indicate a deletion followed by an add:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
D    foo.c
A    foo.c
</pre></div><p>Most merges involve comparing trees that are ancestrally
        related to one another; therefore, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span> defaults to this behavior.  Occasionally,
        however, you may want the <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command to
        compare two unrelated trees.  For example, you may have
        imported two source-code trees representing different vendor
        releases of a software project (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.vendorbr" title="Vendor Branches">the section called âVendor Branchesâ</a>).  If you ask
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to compare the two trees, you'd
        see the entire first tree being deleted, followed by an add
        of the entire second tree!  In these situations, you'll want
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to do a path-based comparison
        only, ignoring any relations between files and directories.
        Add the <code class="option">--ignore-ancestry</code> option to your
        <span class="command"><strong>merge</strong></span> command, and it will behave just
        like <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>.  (And conversely, the
        <code class="option">--notice-ancestry</code> option will cause
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> to behave like the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> command.)</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The <code class="option">--ignore-ancestry</code> option also disables

        in Java-based software projects.  Files and directories are
        shuffled around and renamed, often causing great disruption
        to everyone working on the project.  Sounds like a perfect
        case to use a branch, doesn't it?  Just create a branch,
        shuffle things around, and then merge the branch back to the
        trunk, right?</p><p>Alas, this scenario doesn't work so well right now and
        is considered one of Subversion's current weak spots.  The
        problem is that Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
        command isn't as robust as it should be, particularly when
        dealing with copy and move operations.</p><p>When you use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to duplicate a
        file, the repository remembers where the new file came from,
        but it fails to transmit that information to the client which
        is running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>.  Instead of telling the client, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Copy
        that file you already have to this new location,</span>â</span> it
        sends down an entirely new file.  This can lead to
        problems, especially because the same thing happens with
        renamed files.  A lesser-known fact about Subversion is that
        it lacks <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">true renames</span>â</span>âthe <span class="command"><strong>svn
        move</strong></span> command is nothing more than an aggregation
        of <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        delete</strong></span>.</p><p>For example, suppose that while working on your private
        branch, you rename <code class="filename">integer.c</code>
        to <code class="filename">whole.c</code>.  Effectively you've created
        a new file in your branch that is a copy of the original
        file, and deleted the original file.  Meanwhile, back
        on <code class="filename">trunk</code>, Sally has committed some
        improvements to <code class="filename">integer.c</code>.  Now you
        decide to merge your branch to the trunk:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cd calc/trunk

$ svn merge --reintegrate ^/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
D    integer.c
A    whole.c
U    .
--- Recording mergeinfo for merge between repository URLs into '.':
 U   .
</pre></div><p>This doesn't look so bad at first glance, but it's also
        probably not what you or Sally expected.  The merge operation
        has deleted the latest version of
        the <code class="filename">integer.c</code> file (the one containing
        Sally's latest changes), and blindly added your
        new <code class="filename">whole.c</code> fileâwhich is a
        duplicate of the <span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span> version
        of <code class="filename">integer.c</code>.  The net effect is that
        merging your <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">rename</span>â</span> to the trunk has removed
        Sally's recent changes from the latest revision!</p><p>This isn't true data loss.  Sally's changes are still in
        the repository's history, but it may not be immediately
        obvious that this has happened.  The moral of this story is
        that until Subversion improves, be very careful about
        merging copies and renames from one branch to
        another.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Blocking Merge-Unaware Clients"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.pre1.5clients"></a>Blocking Merge-Unaware Clients</h3></div></div></div><p>If you've just upgraded your server to Subversion 1.5 or
        later, there's a risk that pre-1.5 Subversion
        clients can cause problems with
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergetracking" title="Merge Tracking">Merge Tracking</a>.
        This is because pre-1.5 clients don't support this feature;
        when one of these older clients performs <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>, it doesn't modify the value of
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property at all.  So the
        subsequent commit, despite being the result of a merge,
        doesn't tell the repository about the duplicated
        changesâthat information is lost.  Later on,
        when <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">merge-aware</span>â</span> clients attempt automatic
        merging, they're likely to run into all sorts of conflicts
        resulting from repeated merges.</p><p>If you and your team are relying on the merge-tracking
        features of Subversion, you may want to configure your
        repository to prevent older clients from committing changes.
        The easy way to do this is by inspecting
        the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">capabilities</span>â</span> parameter in
        the <code class="literal">start-commit</code> hook script.  If the
        client reports itself as having <code class="literal">mergeinfo</code>
        capabilities, the hook script can allow the commit to start.
        If the client doesn't report that capability, have the hook
        deny the commit.

        feature has an extremely complex internal implementation, and
        the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property is the only
        window the user has into the machinery.</p><p>Sometimes mergeinfo will appear on paths that you didn't
        expect to be touched by an operation.  Sometimes mergeinfo
        won't be generated at all, when you expect it to.
        Furthermore, the management of mergeinfo metadata has a whole
        set of taxonomies and behaviors around it, such
        as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">explicit</span>â</span> versus <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">implicit</span>â</span>

        absolutely overwhelming for a typical user.  Second, and more
        importantly, the typical user <span class="emphasis"><em>shouldn't</em></span> have
        to understand these concepts; they should typically remain in the

      after creating your private branch, you checked out a fresh
      working copy of the new repository directory.  Instead, you can
      simply ask Subversion to change your working copy of

      looking just as it would if you'd done a fresh checkout of the
      directory.  It's usually more efficient to
      use this command, because often branches differ by only a small
      degree.  The server sends only the minimal set of changes
      necessary to make your working copy reflect the branch
      directory.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command also takes a
      <code class="option">--revision</code> (<code class="option">-r</code>) option, so you
      need not always move your working copy to the
      <code class="literal">HEAD</code> of the branch.</p><p>Of course, most projects are more complicated than our
      <code class="filename">calc</code> example, and contain multiple

      to happen on only a specific subdirectory, she uses
      <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> to move only that subdirectory to
      the branch.  (Or sometimes users will switch just a single
      working file to the branch!)  That way, the user can continue to
      receive normal <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">trunk</span>â</span> updates to most of her
      working copy, but the switched portions will remain immune
      (unless someone commits a change to her branch).  This feature
      adds a whole new dimension to the concept of a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mixed
      working copy</span>â</span>ânot only can working copies contain a

        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, preserves your local edits.  At
        this point, your working copy is now a reflection of the newly
        created branch, and your next <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>

      <a id="idp36924944" class="indexterm"></a>
      Another common version control concept is a tag.  A tag is
      just a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">snapshot</span>â</span> of a project in time.  In
      Subversion, this idea already seems to be everywhere.  Each
      repository revision is exactly thatâa snapshot of the
      filesystem after each commit.</p><p>However, people often want to give more human-friendly names
      to tags, such as <code class="literal">release-1.0</code>.  And they want
      to make snapshots of smaller subdirectories of the filesystem.
      After all, it's not so easy to remember that release 1.0 of a
      piece of software is a particular subdirectory of revision
      4822.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creating a Simple Tag"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.tags.mksimple"></a>Creating a Simple Tag</h3></div></div></div><p>Once again, <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> comes to the
        rescue.  If you want to create a snapshot of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> exactly as it looks in the
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision, make a copy of it:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/release-1.0 \
           -m "Tagging the 1.0 release of the 'calc' project."

Committed revision 902.
</pre></div><p>This example assumes that a
        <code class="filename">/calc/tags</code> directory already exists.  (If
        it doesn't, you can create it using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        mkdir</strong></span>.)  After the copy completes, the new
        <code class="filename">release-1.0</code> directory is forever a
        snapshot of how the <code class="filename">/trunk</code> directory
        looked in the <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision at the time you
        made the copy.  Of course, you might want to be more precise
        about exactly which revision you copy, in case somebody else
        may have committed changes to the project when you weren't
        looking.  So if you know that revision 901 of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> is exactly the snapshot you
        want, you can specify it by passing <code class="option">-r 901</code> to
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> command.</p><p>But wait a moment: isn't this tag creation procedure the
        same procedure we used to create a branch?  Yes, in fact, it
        is.  In Subversion, there's no difference between a tag and a
        branch.  Both are just ordinary directories that are created
        by copying.  Just as with branches, the only reason a copied
        directory is a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">tag</span>â</span> is because
        <span class="emphasis"><em>humans</em></span> have decided to treat it that way:
        as long as nobody ever commits to the directory, it forever
        remains a snapshot.  If people start committing to it, it
        becomes a branch.</p><p>If you are administering a repository, there are two
        approaches you can take to managing tags.  The first approach
        is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">hands off</span>â</span>: as a matter of project policy,
        decide where your tags will live, and make sure all users know
        how to treat the directories they copy.  (That is, make sure
        they know not to commit to them.)  The second approach is more
        paranoid: you can use one of the access control scripts
        provided with Subversion to prevent anyone from doing anything
        but creating new copies in the tags area (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Server Configuration">ChapterÂ 6, <em>Server Configuration</em></a>).  The paranoid approach,
        however, isn't usually necessary.  If a user accidentally
        commits a change to a tag directory, you can simply undo the
        change as discussed in the previous section.  This is version
        control, after all!</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Creating a Complex Tag"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.tags.mkcomplex"></a>Creating a Complex Tag</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes you may want a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">snapshot</span>â</span> that is
        more complicated than a single directory at a single
        revision.</p><p>For example, pretend your project is much larger than our
        <code class="filename">calc</code> example: suppose it contains a
        number of subdirectories and many more files.  In the course
        of your work, you may decide that you need to create a working
        copy that is designed to have specific features and bug fixes.
        You can accomplish this by selectively backdating files or
        directories to particular revisions (using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> with the <code class="option">-r</code> option
        liberally), by switching files and directories to particular
        branches (making use of <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>), or
        even just by making a bunch of local changes.  When you're
        done, your working copy is a hodgepodge of repository
        locations from different revisions.  But after testing, you
        know it's the precise combination of data you need to
        tag.</p><p>Time to make a snapshot.  Copying one URL to another won't
        work here.  In this case, you want to make a snapshot of your
        exact working copy arrangement and store it in the repository.
        Luckily, <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> actually has four
        different uses (which you can read about in <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>), including the ability to copy a
        working copy tree to the repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ ls
my-working-copy/

$ svn copy my-working-copy \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/mytag \
           -m "Tag my existing working copy state."

Committed revision 940.
</pre></div><p>Now there is a new directory in the repository,
        <code class="filename">/calc/tags/mytag</code>, which is an exact
        snapshot of your working copyâmixed revisions, URLs,
        local changes, and all.</p><p>Other users have found interesting uses for this feature.
        Sometimes there are situations where you have a bunch of local
        changes made to your working copy, and you'd like a
        collaborator to see them.  Instead of running <span class="command"><strong>svn
        diff</strong></span> and sending a patch file (which won't capture
        directory or symlink changes), you can
        use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">upload</span>â</span> your
        working copy to a private area of the repository.  Your
        collaborator can then either check out a verbatim copy of your
        working copy or use <span class="command"><strong>svn merge</strong></span> to receive
        your exact changes.</p><p>While this is a nice method for uploading a quick snapshot
        of your working copy, note that this is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
        a good way to initially create a branch.  Branch creation should
        be an event unto itself, and this method conflates the creation
        of a branch with extra changes to files, all within a single revision.
        This makes it very difficult (later on) to identify a single
        revision number as a branch point.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Branch Maintenance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.branchmerge.maint"></a>Branch Maintenance</h2></div></div></div><p>You may have noticed by now that Subversion is extremely
      flexible.  Because it implements branches and tags with the same
      underlying mechanism (directory copies), and because branches
      and tags appear in normal filesystem space, many people find
      Subversion intimidating.  It's almost <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span>
      flexible.  In this section, we'll offer some suggestions for
      arranging and managing your data over time.</p><div class="sect2" title="Repository Layout"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.maint.layout"></a>Repository Layout</h3></div></div></div><p>There are some standard, recommended ways to organize the
        contents of a repository.  Most people create a
        <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory to hold the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">main
        line</span>â</span> of development, a <code class="filename">branches</code>
        directory to contain branch copies, and
        a <code class="filename">tags</code> directory to contain tag copies.
        If a repository holds only one project, often people create
        these top-level directories:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/<br></br>
Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>
Â Â Â branches/<br></br>
Â Â Â tags/<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>If a repository contains multiple projects, admins
        typically index their layout by project.  See <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="Planning Your Repository Organization">the section called âPlanning Your Repository Organizationâ</a> to read more about
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">project roots</span>â</span>, but here's an example of such a
        layout:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/<br></br>
Â Â Â paint/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â branches/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â tags/<br></br>
Â Â Â calc/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â branches/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â tags/<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>Of course, you're free to ignore these common layouts.
        You can create any sort of variation, whatever works best for
        you or your team.  Remember that whatever you choose, it's not
        a permanent commitment.  You can reorganize your repository at
        any time.  Because branches and tags are ordinary directories,
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span> command can move or rename
        them however you wish.  Switching from one layout to another
        is just a matter of issuing a series of server-side moves; if
        you don't like the way things are organized in the repository,
        just juggle the directories around.</p><p>Remember, though, that while moving directories is
        easy to do, you need to be considerate of other users as well.
        Your juggling can disorient users with existing
        working copies.  If a user has a working copy of a particular
        repository directory and your <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>
        subcommand removes the path from the latest revision, then
        when the user next runs <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, she is
        told that her working copy represents a path that no
        longer exists.  She is then forced to <span class="command"><strong>svn
        switch</strong></span> to the new location.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Data Lifetimes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.maint.lifetime"></a>Data Lifetimes</h3></div></div></div><p>Another nice feature of Subversion's model is that
        branches and tags can have finite lifetimes, just like any
        other versioned item.  For example, suppose you eventually
        finish all your work on your personal branch of the
        <code class="filename">calc</code> project.  After merging all of your
        changes back into <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, there's
        no need for your private branch directory to stick around
        anymore:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
             -m "Removing obsolete branch of calc project."

Committed revision 375.
</pre></div><p>And now your branch is gone.  Of course, it's not really
        gone: the directory is simply missing from the
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision, no longer distracting
        anyone.  If you use <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, or <span class="command"><strong>svn list</strong></span>
        to examine an earlier revision, you can still see
        your old branch.</p><p>If browsing your deleted directory isn't enough, you can
        always bring it back.  Resurrecting data is very easy in
        Subversion.  If there's a deleted directory (or file) that
        you'd like to bring back into <code class="literal">HEAD</code>, simply
        use <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> to copy it from the old
        revision:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch@374 \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
           -m "Restore my-calc-branch."

Committed revision 376.
</pre></div><p>In our example, your personal branch had a relatively
        short lifetime: you may have created it to fix a bug or
        implement a new feature.  When your task is done, so is the
        branch.  In software development, though, it's also common to
        have two <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">main</span>â</span> branches running side by side for
        very long periods.  For example, suppose it's time to release
        a stable version of the <code class="filename">calc</code> project to the
        public, and you know it's going to take a couple of months to
        shake bugs out of the software.  You don't want people to add
        new features to the project, but you don't want to tell all
        developers to stop programming either.  So instead, you create
        a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">stable</span>â</span> branch of the software that won't
        change much:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/stable-1.0 \
           -m "Creating stable branch of calc project."

Committed revision 377.
</pre></div><p>And now developers are free to continue adding
        cutting-edge (or experimental) features to
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, and you can declare a
        project policy that only bug fixes are to be committed to
        <code class="filename">/calc/branches/stable-1.0</code>.  That is, as
        people continue to work on the trunk, a human selectively
        ports bug fixes over to the stable branch.  Even after the
        stable branch has shipped, you'll probably continue to
        maintain the branch for a long timeâthat is, as long
        as you continue to support that release for customers.  We'll
        discuss this more in the next section.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Common Branching Patterns"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns"></a>Common Branching Patterns</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many different uses for branching and <span class="command"><strong>svn
        merge</strong></span>, and this section describes the most
        common.</p><p>Version control is most often used for software
      development, so here's a quick peek at two of the most common
      branching/merging patterns used by teams of programmers.  If
      you're not using Subversion for software development, feel
      free to skip this section.  If you're a software developer
      using version control for the first time, pay close attention,
      as these patterns are often considered best practices by
      experienced folk.  These processes aren't specific to
      Subversion; they're applicable to any version control system.
      Still, it may help to see them described in Subversion
      terms.</p><div class="sect2" title="Release Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.release"></a>Release Branches</h3></div></div></div><p>Most software has a typical life cycle: code, test,
        release, repeat.  There are two problems with this process.
        First, developers need to keep writing new features while
        quality assurance teams take time to test supposedly stable
        versions of the software.  New work cannot halt while the
        software is tested.  Second, the team almost always needs to
        support older, released versions of software; if a bug is
        discovered in the latest code, it most likely exists in
        released versions as well, and customers will want to get
        that bug fix without having to wait for a major new
        release.</p><p>Here's where version control can help.  The typical
        procedure looks like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Developers commit all new work to the
            trunk.</em></span>  Day-to-day changes are committed to
            <code class="filename">/trunk</code>: new features, bug fixes, and
            so on.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The trunk is copied to a
            <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">release</span>â</span> branch.</em></span>  When the team
            thinks the software is ready for release (say, a 1.0
            release), <code class="filename">/trunk</code> might be copied to
            <code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Teams continue to work in
            parallel.</em></span>  One team begins rigorous testing of
            the release branch, while another team continues new work
            (say, for version 2.0) on <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  If
            bugs are discovered in either location, fixes are ported
            back and forth as necessary.  At some point, however, even
            that process stops.  The branch is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">frozen</span>â</span>
            for final testing right before a release.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The branch is tagged and
            released.</em></span>  When testing is complete,
            <code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code> is copied to
            <code class="filename">/tags/1.0.0</code> as a reference
            snapshot.  The tag is packaged and released to
            customers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The branch is maintained over
            time.</em></span>  While work continues
            on <code class="filename">/trunk</code> for version 2.0, bug fixes
            continue to be ported from <code class="filename">/trunk</code> to
            <code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code>.  When enough
            bug fixes have accumulated, management may decide to do a
            1.0.1 release: <code class="filename">/branches/1.0</code> is
            copied to <code class="filename">/tags/1.0.1</code>, and the tag
            is packaged and released.</p></li></ol></div><p>This entire process repeats as the software matures:
        when the 2.0 work is complete, a new 2.0 release branch is
        created, tested, tagged, and eventually released.  After
        some years, the repository ends up with a number of release
        branches in <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">maintenance</span>â</span> mode, and a number
        of tags representing final shipped versions.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Feature Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.feature"></a>Feature Branches</h3></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">feature branch</em> is the sort of
        branch that's been the dominant example in this chapter (the
        one you've been working on while Sally continues to work on
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code>).  It's a temporary branch created
        to work on a complex change without interfering with the
        stability of <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  Unlike release
        branches (which may need to be supported forever), feature
        branches are born, used for a while, merged back to the trunk,
        and then ultimately deleted.  They have a finite span of
        usefulness.</p><p>Again, project policies vary widely concerning exactly
        when it's appropriate to create a feature branch.  Some
        projects never use feature branches at all: commits to
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code> are a free-for-all.  The
        advantage to this system is that it's simpleânobody
        needs to learn about branching or merging.  The disadvantage
        is that the trunk code is often unstable or unusable.  Other
        projects use branches to an extreme: no change is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ever</em></span> committed to the trunk directly.
        Even the most trivial changes are created on a short-lived
        branch, carefully reviewed, and merged to the trunk.  Then
        the branch is deleted.  This system guarantees an
        exceptionally stable and usable trunk at all times, but at
        the cost of tremendous process overhead.</p><p>Most projects take a middle-of-the-road approach.  They
        commonly insist that <code class="filename">/trunk</code> compile and
        pass regression tests at all times.  A feature branch is
        required only when a change requires a large number of
        destabilizing commits.  A good rule of thumb is to ask this
        question: if the developer worked for days in isolation and
        then committed the large change all at once (so that
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code> were never destabilized), would it
        be too large a change to review?  If the answer to that
        question is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">yes,</span>â</span> the change should be
        developed on a feature branch.  As the developer commits
        incremental changes to the branch, they can be easily reviewed
        by peers.</p><p>Finally, there's the issue of how to best keep a feature
        branch in <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">sync</span>â</span> with the trunk as work
        progresses.  As we mentioned earlier, there's a great risk to
        working on a branch for weeks or months; trunk changes may
        continue to pour in, to the point where the two lines of
        development differ so greatly that it may become a nightmare
        trying to merge the branch back to the trunk.</p><p>This situation is best avoided by regularly merging trunk
        changes to the branch.  Make up a policy: once a week, merge
        the last week's worth of trunk changes to the branch.</p><p>When you are eventually ready to merge the
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">synchronized</span>â</span> feature branch back to the trunk,
        begin by doing a final merge of the latest trunk
        changes to the branch.  When that's done, the latest versions
        of branch and trunk are absolutely identical except for
        your branch changes.  You then merge back with
        the <code class="option">--reintegrate</code> option:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Another way of thinking about this pattern is that your
        weekly sync of trunk to branch is analogous to running
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> in a working copy, while the
        final merge step is analogous to running <span class="command"><strong>svn
        commit</strong></span> from a working copy.  After all, what else
        <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a working copy but a very shallow
        private branch?  It's a branch that's capable of
        storing only one change at a time.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Vendor Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.vendorbr"></a>Vendor Branches</h2></div></div></div><p>As is especially the case when developing software, the data
      that you maintain under version control is often closely related
      to, or perhaps dependent upon, someone else's data.  Generally,
      the needs of your project will dictate that you stay as
      up to date as possible with the data provided by that external
      entity without sacrificing the stability of your own project.
      This scenario plays itself out all the timeâanywhere that
      the information generated by one group of people has a direct
      effect on that which is generated by another group.</p><p>For example, software developers might be working on an
      application that makes use of a third-party library.  Subversion
      has just such a relationship with the Apache Portable Runtime (APR)
      library (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.developer.usingapi.apr" title="The Apache Portable Runtime Library">the section called âThe Apache Portable Runtime Libraryâ</a>).
      The Subversion source code depends on the APR library for all
      its portability needs.  In earlier stages of Subversion's
      development, the project closely tracked APR's changing API,
      always sticking to the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">bleeding edge</span>â</span> of the
      library's code churn.  Now that both APR and Subversion have
      matured, Subversion attempts to synchronize with APR's library
      API only at well-tested, stable release points.</p><p>Now, if your project depends on someone else's information,
      you could attempt to synchronize that information with your own
      in several ways.  Most painfully, you could issue oral or
      written instructions to all the contributors of your project,
      telling them to make sure they have the specific versions
      of that third-party information that your project needs.  If the
      third-party information is maintained in a Subversion
      repository, you could also use Subversion's externals
      definitions to effectively <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pin down</span>â</span> specific
      versions of that information to some location in your own
      working copy (see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externals" title="Externals Definitions">the section called âExternals Definitionsâ</a>).</p><p>But sometimes you want to maintain custom modifications to
      third-party code in your own version control system.  Returning
      to the software development example, programmers might need to
      make modifications to that third-party library for their own
      purposes.  These modifications might include new functionality
      or bug fixes, maintained internally only until they become part
      of an official release of the third-party library.  Or the
      changes might never be relayed back to the library maintainers,
      existing solely as custom tweaks to make the library further
      suit the needs of the software developers.</p><p>Now you face an interesting situation.  Your project could
      house its custom modifications to the third-party data in some
      disjointed fashion, such as using patch files or full-fledged
      alternative versions of files and directories.  But these quickly
      become maintenance headaches, requiring some mechanism by which
      to apply your custom changes to the third-party code and
      necessitating regeneration of those changes with each successive
      version of the third-party code that you track.</p><p>The solution to this problem is to use <em class="firstterm">vendor
      branches</em>.  A vendor branch is a directory tree in
      your own version control system that contains information
      provided by a third-party entity, or vendor.  Each version of
      the vendor's data that you decide to absorb into your project is
      called a <em class="firstterm">vendor drop</em>.</p><p>Vendor branches provide two benefits.  First, by storing
      the currently supported vendor drop in your own version control
      system, you ensure that the members of your project never need to question
      whether they have the right version of the vendor's data.  They
      simply receive that correct version as part of their regular
      working copy updates.  Second, because the data lives in your
      own Subversion repository, you can store your custom changes to
      it in-placeâyou have no more need of an automated (or
      worse, manual) method for swapping in your customizations.</p><div class="sect2" title="General Vendor Branch Management Procedure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.vendorbr.general"></a>General Vendor Branch Management Procedure</h3></div></div></div><p>Managing vendor branches generally works like this: first,
        you create a top-level directory (such as
        <code class="filename">/vendor</code>) to hold the vendor branches.
        Then you import the third-party code into a subdirectory of
        that top-level directory.  You then copy that subdirectory
        into your main development branch (e.g.,
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code>) at the appropriate location.  You
        always make your local changes in the main development branch.
        With each new release of the code you are tracking, you bring
        it into the vendor branch and merge the changes into
        <code class="filename">/trunk</code>, resolving whatever conflicts
        occur between your local changes and the upstream
        changes.</p><p>An example will help to clarify this algorithm.  We'll use
        a scenario where your development team is creating a
        calculator program that links against a third-party complex
        number arithmetic library, libcomplex.  We'll begin with the
        initial creation of the vendor branch and the import of the
        first vendor drop.  We'll call our vendor branch directory
        <code class="filename">libcomplex</code>, and our code drops will go
        into a subdirectory of our vendor branch called
        <code class="filename">current</code>.  And since <span class="command"><strong>svn
        import</strong></span> creates all the intermediate parent
        directories it needs, we can actually accomplish both of these
        steps with a single command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn import /path/to/libcomplex-1.0 \
             http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current \
             -m "importing initial 1.0 vendor drop"
â¦
</pre></div><p>We now have the current version of the libcomplex source
        code in <code class="filename">/vendor/libcomplex/current</code>.  Now,
        we tag that version (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge.tags" title="Tags">the section called âTagsâ</a>)
        and then copy it into the main development branch.  Our copy
        will create a new directory called
        <code class="filename">libcomplex</code> in our existing
        <code class="filename">calc</code> project directory.  It is in this
        copied version of the vendor data that we will make our
        customizations:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current  \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
           -m "tagging libcomplex-1.0"
â¦
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0  \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/libcomplex        \
           -m "bringing libcomplex-1.0 into the main branch"
â¦
</pre></div><p>We check out our project's main branchâwhich now
        includes a copy of the first vendor dropâand we get to
        work customizing the libcomplex code.  Before we know it, our
        modified version of libcomplex is now completely integrated
        into our calculator program.<sup>[<a id="idp37066240" href="#ftn.idp37066240" class="footnote">35</a>]</sup></p><p>A few weeks later, the developers of libcomplex release a
        new version of their libraryâversion 1.1âwhich
        contains some features and functionality that we really want.
        We'd like to upgrade to this new version, but without losing
        the customizations we made to the existing version.  What we
        essentially would like to do is to replace our current
        baseline version of libcomplex 1.0 with a copy of libcomplex
        1.1, and then re-apply the custom modifications we previously
        made to that library to the new version.  But we actually
        approach the problem from the other direction, applying the
        changes made to libcomplex between versions 1.0 and 1.1 to our
        modified copy of it.</p><p>To perform this upgrade, we check out a copy of our vendor
        branch and replace the code in the
        <code class="filename">current</code> directory with the new libcomplex
        1.1 source code.  We quite literally copy new files on top of
        existing files, perhaps exploding the libcomplex 1.1 release
        tarball atop our existing files and directories.  The goal
        here is to make our <code class="filename">current</code> directory
        contain only the libcomplex 1.1 code and to ensure that all
        that code is under version control.  Oh, and we want to do
        this with as little version control history disturbance as
        possible.</p><p>After replacing the 1.0 code with 1.1 code, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> will show files with local modifications as
        well as, perhaps, some unversioned files.  If we did what we
        were supposed to do, the unversioned files are only those new
        files introduced in the 1.1 release of libcomplexâwe
        run <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> on those to get them under
        version control.  If the 1.1 code no longer has certain files
        that were in the 1.0 tree, it may be hard to notice them;
        you'd have to compare the two trees with some external tool
        and then <span class="command"><strong>svn delete</strong></span> any files present in
        1.0 but not in 1.1.  (Although it might also be just fine to
        let these same files live on in unused obscurity!)  Finally,
        once our <code class="filename">current</code> working copy contains
        only the libcomplex 1.1 code, we commit the changes we made to
        get it looking that way.</p><p>Our <code class="filename">current</code> branch now contains the
        new vendor drop.  We tag the new version as 1.1 (in the same
        way we previously tagged the version 1.0 vendor drop), and
        then merge the differences between the tag of the previous
        version and the new current version into our main development
        branch:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cd working-copies/calc
$ svn merge ^/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
            ^/vendor/libcomplex/current  \
            libcomplex
â¦ # resolve all the conflicts between their changes and our changes
$ svn commit -m "merging libcomplex-1.1 into the main branch"
â¦
</pre></div><p>In the trivial use case, the new version of our
        third-party tool would look, from a files-and-directories
        point of view, just like the previous version.  None of the
        libcomplex source files would have been deleted, renamed, or
        moved to different locationsâthe new version would
        contain only textual modifications against the previous one.
        In a perfect world, our modifications would apply cleanly to
        the new version of the library, with absolutely no
        complications or conflicts.</p><p>But things aren't always that simple, and in fact it is
        quite common for source files to get moved around between
        releases of software.  This complicates the process of
        ensuring that our modifications are still valid for the new
        version of code, and things can quickly degrade into a
        situation where we have to manually re-create our
        customizations in the new version.  Once Subversion knows
        about the history of a given source fileâincluding all
        its previous locationsâthe process of merging in the new
        version of the library is pretty simple.  But we are
        responsible for telling Subversion how the source file layout
        changed from vendor drop to vendor drop.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="svn_load_dirs.pl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.vendorbr.svn_load_dirs"></a>svn_load_dirs.pl</h3></div></div></div><p>Vendor drops that contain more than a few deletes,
        additions, and moves complicate the process of upgrading to
        each successive version of the third-party data.  So
        Subversion supplies the <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span>
        script to assist with this process.  This script automates the
        importing steps we mentioned in the general vendor branch
        management procedure to make sure mistakes are minimized.
        You will still be responsible for using the merge commands to
        merge the new versions of the third-party data into your main
        development branch, but <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span>
        can help you more quickly and easily arrive at that
        stage.</p><p>In short, <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span> is an
        enhancement to <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> that has several
        important characteristics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>It can be run at any point in time to bring an existing
            directory in the repository to exactly match an external
            directory, performing all the necessary adds and deletes,
            and optionally performing moves, too.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It takes care of complicated series of operations between
            which Subversion requires an intermediate commitâsuch
            as before renaming a file or directory twice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It will optionally tag the newly imported directory.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>It will optionally add arbitrary properties to files and
            directories that match a regular expression.</p></li></ul></div><p><span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span> takes three mandatory
        arguments.  The first argument is the URL to the base
        Subversion directory to work in.  This argument is followed by
        the URLârelative to the first argumentâinto which the
        current vendor drop will be imported.  Finally, the third
        argument is the local directory to import.  Using our previous
        example, a typical run of <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span>
        might look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn_load_dirs.pl http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                        \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
â¦
</pre></div><p>You can indicate that you'd like
        <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span> to tag the new vendor drop
        by passing the <code class="option">-t</code> command-line option and
        specifying a tag name.  This tag is another URL relative to
        the first program argument.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn_load_dirs.pl -t libcomplex-1.1                              \
                   http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                        \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
â¦
</pre></div><p>When you run <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span>, it
        examines the contents of your existing <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">current</span>â</span>
        vendor drop and compares them with the proposed new vendor
        drop.  In the trivial case, no files will be in
        one version and not the other, and the script will perform the
        new import without incident.  If, however, there are
        discrepancies in the file layouts between versions,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span> will ask you how
        to resolve those differences.  For example, you
        will have the opportunity to tell the script that you know
        that the file <code class="filename">math.c</code> in version 1.0 of
        libcomplex was renamed to <code class="filename">arithmetic.c</code> in
        libcomplex 1.1.  Any discrepancies not explained by moves
        are treated as regular additions and deletions.</p><p>The script also accepts a separate configuration file for
        setting properties on <span class="emphasis"><em>added</em></span> files and
        directories which match a regular expression.  This configuration
        file is specified to <span class="command"><strong>svn_load_dirs.pl</strong></span> using the
        <code class="option">-p</code> command-line option.  Each line of the
        configuration file is a whitespace-delimited set of two or
        four values: a Perl-style regular expression against which to match the
        added path, a control keyword (either
        <code class="literal">break</code> or <code class="literal">cont</code>), and then
        optionally a property name and value.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
\.png$              break   svn:mime-type   image/png

.*                  break   svn:eol-style   native
</pre></div><p>For each added path, the configured property changes whose
        regular expression matches the path are applied in order,
        unless the control specification is <code class="literal">break</code>
        (which means that no more property changes should be applied
        to that path).  If the control specification is
        <code class="literal">cont</code>âan abbreviation for
        <code class="literal">continue</code>âmatching will continue
        with the next line of the configuration file.</p><p>Any whitespace in the regular expression, property name,
        or property value must be surrounded by either single or
        double quotes.  You can escape quotes that
        are not used for wrapping whitespace by preceding them with a
        backslash (<code class="literal">\</code>) character.  The backslash
        escapes only quotes when parsing the configuration file, so do
        not protect any other characters beyond what is necessary for
        the regular expression.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="To Branch or Not to Branch?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.branchmerge.when"></a>To Branch or Not to Branch?</h2></div></div></div><p>To branch or not to branchâthat is an interesting
      question.  This chapter has provided thus far a pretty deep dive
      into the waters of branching and merging, topics which have
      historically been the premier source of Subversion user
      confusion.  As if the rote actions involved in branching and
      branch management aren't sometimes tricky enough, some users get
      hung up on deciding whether they need to branch at all.  As
      you've learned, Subversion can handle common branching and
      branch management scenarios.  So, the decision of whether or not
      to branch a project's history is rarely a technical one.
      Rather, the social impact of the decision often carries more
      weight.  Let's examine some of the benefits and costs of using
      branches in a software project.</p><p>The most obvious benefit of working on a branch is
      isolation.  Changes made to the branch don't affect the other
      lines of development in the project; changes made to those other
      lines don't affect the branch.  In this way, a branch can serve
      as a great place to experiment with new features, complex bug
      fixes, major code rewrites, and so on.  No matter how much stuff
      Sally breaks on her branch, Harry and the rest of the team can
      continue with their work unhindered outside the branch.</p><p>Branches also provide a great way to organize related
      changes into readily identifiable collections.  For example, the
      changes which comprise the complete solution to a particular bug
      might be a list of non-sequential revision numbers.  You might
      describe them in human language as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revisions 1534, 1543,
      1587 and 1588</span>â</span>.  You'd probably reproduce those numbers
      manually (or otherwise) in the issue tracker artifact which
      tracks the bug.  When porting the bug fix to other product
      versions, you'd need to make sure to port all those revisions.
      But had those changes been made on a unique branch, you'd find
      yourself referring only to that branch by its name in
      conversation, in issue tracker comments, and when porting
      changes.</p><p>The unfortunate downside of branches, though, is that the
      very isolation that makes them so
      useful <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be at odds with the
      collaborative needs of the project team.  Depending on the work
      habits of your project peers, changes made to branches might not
      get the kind of constructive review, criticism, and testing that
      changes made to the main line of development do.  The isolation
      of a branch can encourage users to forsake certain version
      control <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">best practices</span>â</span>, leading to version
      history which is difficult to review <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">post
      facto</em></span>.  Developers on long-lived branches
      sometimes need to work extra hard to ensure that the
      evolutionary direction of their isolated copy of the codebase is
      in harmony with the direction their peers are steering the main
      code lines.  Now, these drawbacks might be less of an issue for
      true exploratory branches aimed at experimenting with the future
      of a codebase with no expectation of reintegrating the results
      back into the main development linesâmere policy needn't
      be a vision-killer!  But the simple fact remains that projects
      generally benefit from an orderly approach to version control
      where code and code changes enjoy the review and comprehension
      of more than one team member.</p><p>That's not to say that there are no technical penalties to
      branching.  Pardon us while we <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">go meta</span>â</span> for a bit
      here.  If you think about it, every time you checkout a
      Subversion working copy, you're creating a branch of sorts of
      your project.  It's a special sort of branch.  It lives only on
      your client machine; not in the repository.  You synchronize
      this branch with changes made in the repository
      using <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>âwhich acts almost like
      a special-cased, simplified form of an <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> command.<sup>[<a id="idp37123536" href="#ftn.idp37123536" class="footnote">36</a>]</sup> You effectively reintegrate your branch
      each time you run <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>.  So, in that
      special sense, Subversion users deal with branches and merges
      all the time.  Given the similarities between updating and
      merging, it's no surprise, then, that the areas in which
      Subversion seems to have the most shortcomingsânamely,
      handling file and directory renames and dealing with tree
      conflicts in generalâare problematic for both
      the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> operations.  Unfortunately, <span class="command"><strong>svn
      merge</strong></span> has a harder time of it precisely because of the
      fact that, for every way in which <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
      is a special-cased, simplified kind of generic merge operation,
      a true Subversion merge is neither special-cased nor simplified.
      For this reason, merges perform much more slowly than updates,
      require explicit tracking (via
      the <code class="literal">svn:mergeinfo</code> property we've discussed in
      this chapter) and history-crunching arithmetic, and generally
      offer more opportunities for something to go awry.</p><p>To branch or not to branch?  Ultimately, that depends on

      the use of <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> to create

    your versioned data.  As such, it becomes an obvious candidate for
    all the love and attention an administrator can offer.  While the
    repository is generally a low-maintenance item, it is important to
    understand how to properly configure and care for it so that
    potential problems are avoided, and so actual problems are safely
    resolved.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll discuss how to create and configure a
    Subversion repository.  We'll also talk about repository
    maintenance, providing examples of how and when to use various
    related tools provided with Subversion.  We'll address some common
    questions and mistakes and give some suggestions on how to arrange
    the data in the repository.</p><p>If you plan to access a Subversion repository only in the role
    of a user whose data is under version control (i.e., via a
    Subversion client), you can skip this chapter altogether.
    However, if you are, or wish to become, a Subversion repository
    administrator,<sup>[<a id="idp38084352" href="#ftn.idp38084352" class="footnote">37</a>]</sup> this chapter is for you.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Subversion Repository, Defined"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.reposadmin.basics"></a>The Subversion Repository, Defined</h2></div></div></div><p>Before jumping into the broader topic of repository
      administration, let's further define what a repository is.  How
      does it look?  How does it feel?  Does it take its tea hot or
      iced, sweetened, and with lemon?  As an administrator, you'll be
      expected to understand the composition of a repository both from
      a literal, OS-level perspectiveâhow a repository looks and
      acts with respect to non-Subversion toolsâand from a
      logical perspectiveâdealing with how data is represented
      <span class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the repository.</p><p>Seen through the eyes of a typical file browser application
      (such as Windows Explorer) or command-line based filesystem
      navigation tools, the Subversion repository is just another
      directory full of stuff.  There are some subdirectories with
      human-readable configuration files in them, some subdirectories
      with some not-so-human-readable data files, and so on.  As in
      other areas of the Subversion design, modularity is given high
      regard, and hierarchical organization is preferred to cluttered
      chaos.  So a shallow glance into a typical repository from a
      nuts-and-bolts perspective is sufficient to reveal the basic
      components of the repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

      otherwise unremarkable collection of files and directories
      suddenly becomes an implementation of a virtual, versioned
      filesystem, complete with customizable event triggers.  This
      filesystem has its own notions of directories and files, very
      similar to the notions of such things held by real filesystems
      (such as NTFS, FAT32, ext3, etc.).  But this is a special
      filesystemâit hangs these directories and files from
      revisions, keeping all the changes you've ever made to them
      safely stored and forever accessible.  This is where the
      entirety of your versioned data lives.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Strategies for Repository Deployment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.reposadmin.planning"></a>Strategies for Repository Deployment</h2></div></div></div><p>Due largely to the simplicity of the overall design of the
      Subversion repository and the technologies on which it relies,
      creating and configuring a repository are fairly straightforward
      tasks.  There are a few preliminary decisions you'll want to
      make, but the actual work involved in any given setup of a
      Subversion repository is pretty basic, tending toward
      mindless repetition if you find yourself setting up multiples of
      these things.</p><p>Some things you'll want to consider beforehand, though, are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>What data do you expect to live in your repository (or
          repositories), and how will that data be organized?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Where will your repository live, and how will it be
          accessed?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>What types of access control and repository event
          reporting do you need?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Which of the available types of data store do you want
          to use?</p></li></ul></div><p>In this section, we'll try to help you answer those
      questions.</p><div class="sect2" title="Planning Your Repository Organization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"></a>Planning Your Repository Organization</h3></div></div></div><p>While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files
        and directories without any loss of information, and even
        provides ways of moving whole sets of versioned history from
        one repository to another, doing so can greatly disrupt the
        workflow of those who access the repository often and come to
        expect things to be at certain locations.  So before creating
        a new repository, try to peer into the future a bit; plan
        ahead before placing your data under version control.  By
        conscientiously <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">laying out</span>â</span> your repository or
        repositories and their versioned contents ahead of time, you
        can prevent many future headaches.</p><p>Let's assume that as repository administrator, you will be
        responsible for supporting the version control system for
        several projects.  Your first decision is whether to use a
        single repository for multiple projects, or to give each
        project its own repository, or some compromise of these
        two.</p><p>There are benefits to using a single repository for
        multiple projects, most obviously the lack of duplicated
        maintenance.  A single repository means that there is one set
        of hook programs, one thing to routinely back up, one thing to
        dump and load if Subversion releases an incompatible new
        version, and so on.  Also, you can move data between projects
        easily, without losing any historical versioning
        information.</p><p>The downside of using a single repository is that
        different projects may have different requirements in terms of
        the repository event triggers, such as needing to send commit
        notification emails to different mailing lists, or having
        different definitions about what does and does not constitute
        a legitimate commit.  These aren't insurmountable problems, of
        courseâit just means that all of your hook scripts have
        to be sensitive to the layout of your repository rather than
        assuming that the whole repository is associated with a single
        group of people.  Also, remember that Subversion uses
        repository-global revision numbers.  While those numbers don't
        have any particular magical powers, some folks still don't
        like the fact that even though no changes have been made to
        their project lately, the youngest revision number for the
        repository keeps climbing because other projects are actively
        adding new revisions.<sup>[<a id="idp38155200" href="#ftn.idp38155200" class="footnote">39</a>]</sup></p><p>A middle-ground approach can be taken, too.  For example,
        projects can be grouped by how well they relate to each other.
        You might have a few repositories with a handful of projects
        in each repository.  That way, projects that are likely to
        want to share data can do so easily, and as new revisions are
        added to the repository, at least the developers know that
        those new revisions are at least remotely related to everyone
        who uses that repository.</p><p>

        After deciding how to organize your projects with respect
        to repositories, you'll probably want to think about directory
        hierarchies within the repositories themselves.  Because
        Subversion uses regular directory copies for branching and
        tagging (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge" title="ChapterÂ 4.Â Branching and Merging">ChapterÂ 4, <em>Branching and Merging</em></a>), the
        Subversion community recommends that you choose a repository
        location for each project
        rootâthe <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">topmost</span>â</span> directory
        that contains data related to that projectâand then
        create three subdirectories beneath that root:
        <code class="filename">trunk</code>, meaning the directory under which
        the main project development occurs;
        <code class="filename">branches</code>, which is a directory in which
        to create various named branches of the main development line;
        and <code class="filename">tags</code>, which is a collection of tree
        snapshots that are created, and perhaps destroyed, but never
        changed.<sup>[<a id="idp38177712" href="#ftn.idp38177712" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup></p><p>For example, your repository might look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/<br></br>
Â Â Â calc/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>

</p></div></div><p>Note that it doesn't matter where in your repository each
        project root is.  If you have only one project per repository,
        the logical place to put each project root is at the root of
        that project's respective repository.  If you have multiple
        projects, you might want to arrange them in groups inside the
        repository, perhaps putting projects with similar goals or
        shared code in the same subdirectory, or maybe just grouping
        them alphabetically.  Such an arrangement might look
        like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>

</p></div></div><p>Lay out your repository in whatever way you see fit.
        Subversion does not expect or enforce a particular layoutâin
        its eyes, a directory is a directory is a directory.
        Ultimately, you should choose the repository arrangement that
        meets the needs of the people who work on the projects that
        live there.</p><p>In the name of full disclosure, though, we'll mention
        another very common layout.  In this layout, the
        <code class="filename">trunk</code>, <code class="filename">tags</code>, and
        <code class="filename">branches</code> directories live in the root
        directory of your repository, and your projects are in
        subdirectories beneath those, like so:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/<br></br>
Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>

Â Â Â Â Â Â â¦<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a
        layout, but it may or may not seem as intuitive for your
        users.  Especially in large, multiproject situations with
        many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one
        or two of the projects in the repository.  But the
        projects-as-branch-siblings approach tends to deemphasize project
        individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a
        single entity.  That's a social issue, though.  We like our
        originally suggested arrangement for purely practical
        reasonsâit's easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate
        elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's
        a single repository path that holds the entire
        historyâpast, present, tagged, and branchedâfor
        that project and that project alone.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Deciding Where and How to Host Your Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.basics.hosting"></a>Deciding Where and How to Host Your Repository</h3></div></div></div><p>Before creating your Subversion repository, an obvious
        question you'll need to answer is where the thing is going to
        live.  This is strongly connected to myriad other
        questions involving how the repository will be accessed (via a
        Subversion server or directly), by whom (users behind your
        corporate firewall or the whole world out on the open
        Internet), what other services you'll be providing around
        Subversion (repository browsing interfaces, email-based
        commit notification, etc.), your data backup strategy, and so
        on.</p><p>We cover server choice and configuration in <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Server Configuration">ChapterÂ 6, <em>Server Configuration</em></a>, but the point we'd like to
        briefly make here is simply that the answers to some of these
        other questions might have implications that force your hand
        when deciding where your repository will live.  For example,
        certain deployment scenarios might require accessing the
        repository via a remote filesystem from multiple computers, in
        which case (as you'll read in the next section) your choice of
        a repository backend data store turns out not to be a choice
        at all because only one of the available backends will work
        in this scenario.</p><p>Addressing each possible way to deploy
        Subversion is both impossible and outside the scope of this
        book.  We simply encourage you to evaluate your options using
        these pages and other sources as your reference material and to
        plan ahead.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Choosing a Data Store"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends"></a>Choosing a Data Store</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion provides two options for the
        type of underlying data storeâoften referred to as
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">the backend</span>â</span> or, somewhat confusingly,
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">the (versioned) filesystem</span>â</span>âthat each
        repository uses.  One type of data store keeps everything in a
        Berkeley DB (or BDB) database environment; repositories that
        use this type are often referred to as being
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">BDB-backed.</span>â</span> The other type stores data in
        ordinary flat files, using a custom format.  Subversion
        developers have adopted the habit of referring to this latter
        data storage mechanism
        as <em class="firstterm">FSFS</em><sup>[<a id="idp38200752" href="#ftn.idp38200752" class="footnote">41</a>]</sup>âa

        two backend types.  Neither of them is more
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">official</span>â</span> than the other, though the newer FSFS
        is the default data store as of Subversion 1.2.  Both are
        reliable enough to trust with your versioned data.  But as you
        can see in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.tbl-1" title="TableÂ 5.1.Â Repository data store comparison">TableÂ 5.1, âRepository data store comparisonâ</a>, the FSFS
        backend provides quite a bit more flexibility in terms of its
        supported deployment scenarios.  More flexibility means you
        have to work a little harder to find ways to deploy it
        incorrectly.  Those reasonsâplus the fact that not using
        Berkeley DB means there's one fewer component in the
        systemâlargely explain why today almost everyone uses
        the FSFS backend when creating new repositories.</p><p>Fortunately, most programs that access Subversion
        repositories are blissfully ignorant of which backend data
        store is in use.  And you aren't even necessarily stuck with
        your first choice of a data storeâin the event that you
        change your mind later, Subversion provides ways of migrating
        your repository's data into another repository that uses a
        different backend data store.  We talk more about that later
        in this chapter.</p><p>The following subsections provide a more detailed look at
        the available backend data store types.</p><div class="sect3" title="Berkeley DB"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb"></a>Berkeley DB</h4></div></div></div><p>When the initial design phase of Subversion was in
          progress, the developers decided to use Berkeley DB for a
          variety of reasons, including its open source license,
          transaction support, reliability, performance, API
          simplicity, thread safety, support for cursors, and so
          on.</p><p>Berkeley DB provides real transaction
          supportâperhaps its most powerful feature.  Multiple
          processes accessing your Subversion repositories don't have
          to worry about accidentally clobbering each other's data.
          The isolation provided by the transaction system is such
          that for any given operation, the Subversion repository code
          sees a static view of the databaseânot a database that
          is constantly changing at the hand of some other
          processâand can make decisions based on that view.  If
          the decision made happens to conflict with what another
          process is doing, the entire operation is rolled back as though
          it never happened, and Subversion gracefully retries the
          operation against a new, updated (and yet still static) view
          of the database.</p><p>Another great feature of Berkeley DB is <em class="firstterm">hot
          backups</em>âthe ability to back up the
          database environment without taking it
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">offline.</span>â</span> We'll discuss how to back up your
          repository later in this chapter (in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.backup" title="Repository Backup">the section called âRepository Backupâ</a>), but the benefits
          of being able to make fully functional copies of your
          repositories without any downtime should be obvious.</p><p>Berkeley DB is also a very reliable database system when
          properly used.  Subversion uses Berkeley DB's logging
          facilities, which means that the database first writes to
          on-disk logfiles a description of any modifications it is
          about to make, and then makes the modification itself.  This
          is to ensure that if anything goes wrong, the database
          system can back up to a previous
          <em class="firstterm">checkpoint</em>âa location in the
          logfiles known not to be corruptâand replay
          transactions until the data is restored to a usable state.
          See <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace" title="Managing Disk Space">the section called âManaging Disk Spaceâ</a> later
          in this chapter for more about Berkeley DB logfiles.</p><p>But every rose has its thorn, and so we must note some
          known limitations of Berkeley DB.  First, Berkeley DB
          environments are not portable.  You cannot simply copy a
          Subversion repository that was created on a Unix system onto
          a Windows system and expect it to work.  While much of the
          Berkeley DB database format is architecture-independent,
          other aspects of the environment are not.
          Second, Subversion uses Berkeley DB in a way that will not
          operate on Windows 95/98 systemsâif you need to house
          a BDB-backed repository on a Windows machine, stick with
          Windows 2000 or later.</p><p>While Berkeley DB promises to behave correctly on
          network shares that meet a particular set of
          specifications,<sup>[<a id="idp38242736" href="#ftn.idp38242736" class="footnote">42</a>]</sup> most
          networked filesystem types and appliances do
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> actually meet those requirements.
          And in no case can you allow a BDB-backed repository that
          resides on a network share to be accessed by multiple
          clients of that share at once (which quite often is the
          whole point of having the repository live on a network share
          in the first place).</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a noncompliant
            remote filesystem, the results are unpredictableâyou
            may see mysterious errors right away, or it may be months
            before you discover that your repository database is
            subtly corrupted.  You should strongly consider using the
            FSFS data store for repositories that need to live on a
            network share.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Finally, because Berkeley DB is a library linked
          directly into Subversion, it's more sensitive to
          interruptions than a typical relational database system.
          Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server
          process that mediates all access to tables.  If a program
          accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database
          daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess
          left behind.  And because the database daemon is the only
          process accessing the tables, applications don't need to
          worry about permission conflicts.  These things are not the
          case with Berkeley DB, however.  Subversion (and programs
          using Subversion libraries) access the database tables
          directly, which means that a program crash can leave the
          database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state.
          When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB
          to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance.
          Other things can cause a repository to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">wedge</span>â</span>
          besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over
          ownership and permissions on the database files.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Berkeley DB 4.4 brings (to Subversion 1.4 and later)
            the ability for Subversion to automatically and
            transparently recover Berkeley DB environments in need of
            such recovery.  When a Subversion process attaches to a
            repository's Berkeley DB environment, it uses some process
            accounting mechanisms to detect any unclean disconnections
            by previous processes, performs any necessary recovery,
            and then continues on as though nothing happened.  This
            doesn't completely eliminate instances of repository
            wedging, but it does drastically reduce the amount of
            human interaction required to recover from them.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>So while a Berkeley DB repository is quite fast and
          scalable, it's best used by a single server process running
          as one userâsuch as Apache's <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span>
          or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Server Configuration">ChapterÂ 6, <em>Server Configuration</em></a>)ârather than accessing it
          as many different users via <code class="literal">file://</code> or
          <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs.  If you're accessing a Berkeley
          DB repository directly as multiple users, be sure to read
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.multimethod" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ</a> later in this
          chapter.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="FSFS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs"></a>FSFS</h4></div></div></div><p>In mid-2004, a second type of repository storage
          systemâone that doesn't use a database at
          allâcame into being.  An FSFS repository stores the
          changes associated with a revision in a single file, and so
          all of a repository's revisions can be found in a single
          subdirectory full of numbered files.  Transactions are
          created in separate subdirectories as individual files.
          When complete, the transaction file is renamed and moved
          into the revisions directory, thus guaranteeing that commits
          are atomic.  And because a revision file is permanent and
          unchanging, the repository also can be backed up while
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">hot,</span>â</span> just like a BDB-backed
          repository.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Revision files and shards"><a id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs.revfiles"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Revision files and shards</strong></p></div></div></div><p>FSFS repositories contain files that describe the
            changes made in a single revision, and files that contain
            the revision properties associated with a single revision.
            Repositories created in versions of Subversion prior to
            1.5 keep these files in two directoriesâone for each
            type of file.  As new revisions are committed to the
            repository, Subversion drops more files into these two
            directoriesâover time, the number of these files in
            each directory can grow to be quite large.  This has been
            observed to cause performance problems on certain
            network-based filesystems.</p><p>Subversion 1.5 creates FSFS-backed repositories using
            a slightly modified layout in which the contents of these
            two directories are <em class="firstterm">sharded</em>, or
            scattered across several subdirectories.  This can greatly
            reduce the time it takes the system to locate any one of
            these files, and therefore increases the overall
            performance of Subversion when reading from the
            repository.</p><p>Subversion 1.6 and later takes the sharded layout one
            step further, allowing administrators to
            optionally <em class="firstterm">pack</em> each of their
            repository shards up into a single multi-revision file.
            This can have both performance and disk usage benefits.
            See
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.fsfspacking" title="Packing FSFS filesystems">the section called âPacking FSFS filesystemsâ</a>
            for more information.</p></div><p>The FSFS revision files describe a revision's
          directory structure, file contents, and deltas against files
          in other revision trees.  Unlike a Berkeley DB database,
          this storage format is portable across different operating
          systems and isn't sensitive to CPU architecture.  Because
          no journaling or shared-memory files are being used, the
          repository can be safely accessed over a network filesystem
          and examined in a read-only environment.  The lack of
          database overhead also means the overall repository
          size is a bit smaller.</p><p>FSFS has different performance characteristics, too.
          When committing a directory with a huge number of files,
          FSFS is able to more quickly append directory entries.  On
          the other hand, FSFS has a longer delay when finalizing a
          commit while it performs tasks that the BDB backend
          amortizes across the lifetime of the commit, which could in
          extreme cases cause clients to time out while waiting for a
          response.</p><p>The most important distinction, however, is FSFS's
          imperviousness to wedging when something goes wrong.  If a
          process using a Berkeley DB database runs into a permissions
          problem or suddenly crashes, the database can be left in an
          unusable state until an administrator recovers it.  If the
          same scenarios happen to a process using an FSFS repository,
          the repository isn't affected at all.  At worst, some
          transaction data is left behind.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Creating and Configuring Your Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.reposadmin.create"></a>Creating and Configuring Your Repository</h2></div></div></div><p>Earlier in this chapter (in

        task.  The <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> utility that comes with
        Subversion provides a subcommand (<span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
        create</strong></span>) for doing just that.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        <code class="filename">/var/svn</code> exists and that you have
        sufficient permissions to modify that directory, the previous
        command creates a new repository in the directory
        <code class="filename">/var/svn/repos</code>, and with the default
        filesystem data store (FSFS).  You can explicitly choose the
        filesystem type using the <code class="option">--fs-type</code> argument,
        which accepts as a parameter either <code class="literal">fsfs</code> or
        <code class="literal">bdb</code>.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

        repository.  Depending on how users will access this new
        repository, you might need to fiddle with its filesystem
        permissions.  But since basic system administration is rather
        outside the scope of this text, we'll leave further

        some repository event, such as the creation of a new revision
        or the modification of an unversioned property.  Some hooks
        (the so-called <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pre hooks</span>â</span>) run in advance of a
        repository operation and provide a means by which to both
        report what is about to happen and prevent it from
        happening at all.  Other hooks (the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">post hooks</span>â</span>)
        run after the completion of a repository event and are useful
        for performing tasks that examineâbut don't
        modifyâthe repository.  Each hook is handed enough
        information to tell what that event is (or was), the specific
        repository changes proposed (or completed), and the username
        of the person who triggered the event.</p><p>The <code class="filename">hooks</code> subdirectory is, by
        default, filled with templates for various repository
        hooks:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ ls repos/hooks/
post-commit.tmpl          post-unlock.tmpl  pre-revprop-change.tmpl
post-lock.tmpl            pre-commit.tmpl   pre-unlock.tmpl
post-revprop-change.tmpl  pre-lock.tmpl     start-commit.tmpl
$
</pre></div><p>There is one template for each hook that the Subversion
        repository supports; by examining the contents of those
        template scripts, you can see what triggers each script
        to run and what data is passed to that script.  Also present
        in many of these templates are examples of how one might use
        that script, in conjunction with other Subversion-supplied
        programs, to perform common useful tasks.  To actually install
        a working hook, you need only place some executable program or
        script into the <code class="filename">repos/hooks</code> directory,
        which can be executed as the name (such as
        <span class="command"><strong>start-commit</strong></span> or
        <span class="command"><strong>post-commit</strong></span>) of the hook.</p><p>On Unix platforms, this means supplying a script or
        program (which could be a shell script, a Python program, a
        compiled C binary, or any number of other things) named
        exactly like the name of the hook.  Of course, the template
        files are present for more than just informational
        purposesâthe easiest way to install a hook on Unix
        platforms is to simply copy the appropriate template file to a
        new file that lacks the <code class="filename">.tmpl</code> extension,
        customize the hook's contents, and ensure that the script is
        executable.  Windows, however, uses file extensions to
        determine whether a program is executable, so you would
        need to supply a program whose basename is the name of the
        hook and whose extension is one of the special extensions
        recognized by Windows for executable programs, such as
        <code class="filename">.exe</code> for programs and
        <code class="filename">.bat</code> for batch files.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>For security reasons, the Subversion repository executes
          hook programs with an empty environmentâthat is, no
          environment variables are set at all, not even
          <code class="literal">$PATH</code> (or <code class="literal">%PATH%</code>,
          under Windows).  Because of this, many administrators
          are baffled when their hook program runs fine by hand, but
          doesn't work when run by Subversion.  Be sure to explicitly
          set any necessary environment variables in your hook program
          and/or use absolute paths to programs.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Subversion executes hooks as the same user who owns the
        process that is accessing the Subversion repository.  In most
        cases, the repository is being accessed via a Subversion
        server, so this user is the same user as whom the server
        runs on the system.  The hooks themselves will need to be
        configured with OS-level permissions that allow that user to
        execute them.  Also, this means that any programs or files
        (including the Subversion repository) accessed directly
        or indirectly by the hook will be accessed as the same user.
        In other words, be alert to potential permission-related
        problems that could prevent the hook from performing the tasks
        it is designed to perform.</p><p>There are several hooks implemented by the Subversion
        repository, and you can get details about each of them in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.reposhooks" title="Repository Hooks">the section called âRepository Hooksâ</a> in
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.  As a repository
        administrator, you'll need to decide which hooks you wish
        to implement (by way of providing an appropriately named and
        permissioned hook program), and how.  When you make this
        decision, keep in mind
        the big picture of how your repository is deployed.
        For example, if you are using server configuration
        to determine which users are permitted to commit
        changes to your repository, you don't need to do this
        sort of access control via the hook system.</p><p>There is no shortage of Subversion hook programs and
        scripts that are freely available either from the Subversion community
        itself or elsewhere.  These scripts cover a wide range of
        utilityâbasic access control, policy adherence checking,
        issue tracker integration, email- or syndication-based commit
        notification, and beyond.  Or, if you wish to write your own,

          anything, there is one dimension in which hook script
          authors should show restraint:  do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
          modify a commit transaction using hook scripts.  While it
          might be tempting to use hook scripts to automatically
          correct errors, shortcomings, or policy violations present
          in the files being committed, doing so can cause problems.
          Subversion keeps client-side caches of certain bits of
          repository data, and if you change a commit transaction in
          this way, those caches become indetectably stale.  This
          inconsistency can lead to surprising and unexpected
          behavior.  Instead of modifying the transaction, you should
          simply <span class="emphasis"><em>validate</em></span> the transaction in the
          <code class="filename">pre-commit</code> hook and reject the commit
          if it does not meet the desired requirements.  As a
          bonus, your users will learn the value of careful,
          compliance-minded work habits.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Berkeley DB Configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.create.bdb"></a>Berkeley DB Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>A Berkeley DB environment is an encapsulation of one or
        more databases, logfiles, region files, and configuration
        files.  The Berkeley DB environment has its own set of default
        configuration values for things such as the number of database
        locks allowed to be taken out at any given time, the maximum
        size of the journaling logfiles, and so on.  Subversion's
        filesystem logic additionally chooses default values for some
        of the Berkeley DB configuration options.  However, sometimes
        your particular repository, with its unique collection of data
        and access patterns, might require a different set of
        configuration option values.</p><p>The producers of Berkeley DB understand that different
        applications and database environments have different
        requirements, so they have provided a mechanism for overriding
        at runtime many of the configuration values for the Berkeley
        DB environment.  BDB checks for the presence of a file named
        <code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> in the environment directory
        (namely, the repository's <code class="filename">db</code>
        subdirectory), and parses the options found in that file.
        Subversion itself creates this file when it creates the rest
        of the repository.  The file initially contains some default
        options, as well as pointers to the Berkeley DB online
        documentation so that you can read about what those options do.  Of
        course, you are free to add any of the supported Berkeley DB
        options to your <code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> file.  Just be
        aware that while Subversion never attempts to read or
        interpret the contents of the file and makes no direct use of
        the option settings in it, you'll want to avoid any
        configuration changes that may cause Berkeley DB to behave in
        a fashion that is at odds with what Subversion might expect.
        Also, changes made to <code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> won't
        take effect until you recover the database environment (using

          (found in the <code class="filename">tools/server-side</code>
          directory of the Subversion source distribution) is a useful
          performance tuning tool for administrators of FSFS-backed
          Subversion repositories.  As described in the sidebar
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs.revfiles" title="Revision files and shards">Revision files and shards</a>,
          FSFS repositories use individual files to house information
          about each revision.  Sometimes these files all live in a
          single directory; sometimes they are sharded across many
          directories.  But the neat thing is that the number of
          directories used to house these files is configurable.

          in.</p><p><span class="command"><strong>fsfs-reshard.py</strong></span> reshuffles the

          reflects the requested number of sharding subdirectories and
          updates the repository configuration to preserve this
          change.  When used in conjunction with the <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin

          upgrading a pre-1.5 Subversion (unsharded) repository to the
          latest filesystem format and sharding its data files (which
          Subversion will not automatically do for you).  This script
          can also be used for fine-tuning an already sharded
          repository.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Berkeley DB utilities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.tk.bdbutil"></a>Berkeley DB utilities</h4></div></div></div><p>If you're using a Berkeley DB repository, all of
          your versioned filesystem's structure and data live in a set
          of database tables within the <code class="filename">db/</code>
          subdirectory of your repository.  This subdirectory is a
          regular Berkeley DB environment directory and can therefore
          be used in conjunction with any of the Berkeley database
          tools, typically provided as part of the Berkeley DB
          distribution.</p><p>For day-to-day Subversion use, these tools are
          unnecessary.  Most of the functionality typically needed for
          Subversion repositories has been duplicated in the
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> tool.  For example,
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin list-unused-dblogs</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin list-dblogs</strong></span> perform a
          subset of what is provided by the Berkeley
          <span class="command"><strong>db_archive</strong></span> utility, and <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
          recover</strong></span> reflects the common use cases of the
          <span class="command"><strong>db_recover</strong></span> utility.</p><p>However, there are still a few Berkeley DB utilities
          that you might find useful.  The <span class="command"><strong>db_dump</strong></span>
          and <span class="command"><strong>db_load</strong></span> programs write and read,
          respectively, a custom file format that describes the keys
          and values in a Berkeley DB database.  Since Berkeley
          databases are not portable across machine architectures,
          this format is a useful way to transfer those databases from
          machine to machine, irrespective of architecture or
          operating system.  As we describe later in this chapter, you
          can also use <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span> for similar purposes, but
          <span class="command"><strong>db_dump</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>db_load</strong></span>
          can do certain jobs just as well and much faster.  They can
          also be useful if the experienced Berkeley DB hacker needs
          to do in-place tweaking of the data in a BDB-backed
          repository for some reason, which is something Subversion's
          utilities won't allow.  Also, the <span class="command"><strong>db_stat</strong></span>
          utility can provide useful information about the status of
          your Berkeley DB environment, including detailed statistics
          about the locking and storage subsystems.</p><p>For more information on the Berkeley DB tool chain,

        past few years, disk usage is still a valid concern for
        administrators seeking to version large amounts of data.
        Every bit of version history information stored in the live
        repository needs to be backed up
        elsewhere, perhaps multiple times as part of rotating backup
        schedules.  It is useful to know what pieces of Subversion's
        repository data need to remain on the live site, which need to
        be backed up, and which can be safely removed.</p><div class="sect3" title="How Subversion saves disk space"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.deltas"></a>How Subversion saves disk space</h4></div></div></div><p>To keep the repository small, Subversion uses
          <em class="firstterm">deltification</em> (or delta-based storage)
          within the repository itself.  Deltification involves
          encoding the representation of a chunk of data as a
          collection of differences against some other chunk of data.
          If the two pieces of data are very similar, this
          deltification results in storage savings for the deltified
          chunkârather than taking up space equal to the size of
          the original data, it takes up only enough space to
          say, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">I look just like this other piece of data over
          here, except for the following couple of changes.</span>â</span>
          The result is that most of the repository data that tends to
          be bulkyânamely, the contents of versioned
          filesâis stored at a much smaller size than the
          original full-text representation of that data.</p><p>While deltified storage has been a part of Subversion's
          design since the very beginning, there have been additional
          improvements made over the years.  Subversion repositories
          created with Subversion 1.4 or later benefit from
          compression of the full-text representations of file
          contents.  Repositories created with Subversion 1.6 or later
          further enjoy the disk space savings afforded by
          <em class="firstterm">representation sharing</em>, a feature
          which allows multiple files or file revisions with identical
          file content to refer to a single shared instance of that data
          rather than each having their own distinct copy thereof.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Because all of the data that is subject to
            deltification in a BDB-backed repository is stored in a
            single Berkeley DB database file, reducing the size of the
            stored values will not immediately reduce the size of the
            database file itself.  Berkeley DB will, however, keep
            internal records of unused areas of the database file and
            consume those areas first before growing the size of the
            database file.  So while deltification doesn't produce
            immediate space savings, it can drastically slow future
            growth of the database.</p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Removing dead transactions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.deadtxns"></a>Removing dead transactions</h4></div></div></div><p>Though they are uncommon, there are circumstances in

          wasn'tâan uncommitted transaction and all the file and
          directory changes associated with it.  This could happen for
          several reasons:  perhaps the client operation was
          inelegantly terminated by the user, or a network failure
          occurred in the middle of an operation.
          Regardless of the reason, dead transactions can happen.

          sort of failed or interrupted commit.  A transaction's

          employed in the decision-making process.  And of course, an
          administrator can often simply communicate with a seemingly
          dead transaction's owner (via email, e.g.) to verify
          that the transaction is, in fact, in a zombie state.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Purging unused Berkeley DB logfiles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.bdblogs"></a>Purging unused Berkeley DB logfiles</h4></div></div></div><p>Until recently, the largest offender of disk space usage
          with respect to BDB-backed Subversion repositories were the
          logfiles in which Berkeley DB performs its prewrites before
          modifying the actual database files.  These files capture
          all the actions taken along the route of changing the
          database from one state to anotherâwhile the database
          files, at any given time, reflect a particular state, the
          logfiles contain all of the many changes along the way
          <span class="emphasis"><em>between</em></span> states.  Thus, they can grow
          and accumulate quite rapidly.</p><p>Fortunately, beginning with the 4.2 release of Berkeley
          DB, the database environment has the ability to remove its
          own unused logfiles automatically.  Any
          repositories created using <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span>
          when compiled against Berkeley DB version 4.2 or later
          will be configured for this automatic logfile removal.  If
          you don't want this feature enabled, simply pass the
          <code class="option">--bdb-log-keep</code> option to the
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin create</strong></span> command.  If you forget
          to do this or change your mind at a later time, simply edit
          the <code class="filename">DB_CONFIG</code> file found in your
          repository's <code class="filename">db</code> directory, comment out
          the line that contains the <code class="literal">set_flags
          DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE</code> directive, and then run
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin recover</strong></span> on your repository to
          force the configuration changes to take effect.  See <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.create.bdb" title="Berkeley DB Configuration">the section called âBerkeley DB Configurationâ</a> for more information about
          database configuration.</p><p>Without some sort of automatic logfile removal in
          place, logfiles will accumulate as you use your repository.
          This is actually somewhat of a feature of the database
          systemâyou should be able to recreate your entire
          database using nothing but the logfiles, so these files can
          be useful for catastrophic database recovery.  But
          typically, you'll want to archive the logfiles that are no
          longer in use by Berkeley DB, and then remove them from disk
          to conserve space.  Use the <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
          list-unused-dblogs</strong></span> command to list the unused
          logfiles:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs.revfiles" title="Revision files and shards">Revision files and shards</a>,
          FSFS-backed Subversion repositories create, by default, a
          new on-disk file for each revision added to the repository.
          Having thousands of these files present on your Subversion
          serverâeven when housed in separate shard
          directoriesâcan lead to inefficiencies.</p><p>The first problem is that the operating system has to
          reference many different files over a short period of time.
          This leads to inefficient use of disk caches and, as a
          result, more time spent seeking across large disks.  Because
          of this, Subversion pays a performance penalty when
          accessing your versioned data.</p><p>The second problem is a bit more subtle.  Because of the
          ways that most filesystems allocate disk space, each file
          claims more space on the disk than it actually uses.  The
          amount of extra space required to house a single file can
          average anywhere from 2 to 16 kilobytes <span class="emphasis"><em>per
          file</em></span>, depending on the underlying
          filesystem in use.  This translates directly
          into a per-revision disk usage penalty for FSFS-backed
          repositories.  The effect is most pronounced in repositories
          which have many small revisions, since the overhead involved
          in storing the revision file quickly outgrows the size of
          the actual data being stored.</p><p>To solve these problems, Subversion 1.6 introduced the
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin pack</strong></span> command.  By concatenating
          all the files of a completed shard into a single <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pack</span>â</span> file
          and then removing the original per-revision
          files, <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin pack</strong></span> reduces the file
          count within a given shard down to just a single file.  In
          doing so, it aids filesystem caches and reduces (to one) the
          number of times a file storage overhead penalty is
          paid.</p><p>Subversion can pack existing sharded repositories which
          have been upgraded to the 1.6 filesystem format or later (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svnadmin.c.upgrade" title="svnadmin upgrade">svnadmin upgrade</a>) in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.  To do so, just
          run <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin pack</strong></span> on the
          repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Because the packing process obtains the required locks
          before doing its work, you can run it on live repositories,
          or even as part of a post-commit hook.  Repacking packed
          shards is legal, but will have no effect on the disk usage
          of the repository.</p><p><span class="command"><strong>svnadmin pack</strong></span> has no effect on
          BDB-backed Subversion repositories.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Berkeley DB Recovery"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.recovery"></a>Berkeley DB Recovery</h3></div></div></div><p>As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb" title="Berkeley DB">the section called âBerkeley DBâ</a>, a Berkeley DB
        repository can sometimes be left in a frozen state if not closed
        properly.  When this happens, an administrator needs to rewind
        the database back into a consistent state.  This is unique to
        BDB-backed repositories, thoughâif you are using
        FSFS-backed ones instead, this won't apply to you.  And for
        those of you using Subversion 1.4 with Berkeley DB 4.4 or
        later, you should find that Subversion has become much more
        resilient in these types of situations.  Still, wedged
        Berkeley DB repositories do occur, and an administrator needs
        to know how to safely deal with this circumstance.</p><p>To protect the data in your repository, Berkeley
        DB uses a locking mechanism.  This mechanism ensures that
        portions of the database are not simultaneously modified by
        multiple database accessors, and that each process sees the
        data in the correct state when that data is being read from
        the database.  When a process needs to change something in the
        database, it first checks for the existence of a lock on the
        target data.  If the data is not locked, the process locks the
        data, makes the change it wants to make, and then unlocks the
        data.  Other processes are forced to wait until that lock is
        removed before they are permitted to continue accessing that
        section of the database.  (This has nothing to do with the
        locks that you, as a user, can apply to versioned files within
        the repository; we try to clear up the confusion caused by
        this terminology collision in the sidebar <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.locking.meanings" title="The Three Meanings of âLockâ">The Three Meanings of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Lock</span>â</span></a>.)</p><p>In the course of using your Subversion repository, fatal
        errors or interruptions can prevent a process from having the
        chance to remove the locks it has placed in the database.  The
        result is that the backend database system gets
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">wedged.</span>â</span>  When this happens, any attempts to
        access the repository hang indefinitely (since each new
        accessor is waiting for a lock to go awayâwhich isn't
        going to happen).</p><p>If this happens to your repository, don't panic.  The
        Berkeley DB filesystem takes advantage of database
        transactions, checkpoints, and prewrite journaling to ensure
        that only the most catastrophic of events<sup>[<a id="idp38522832" href="#ftn.idp38522832" class="footnote">44</a>]</sup> can permanently destroy a database
        environment.  A sufficiently paranoid repository administrator
        will have made off-site backups of the repository data in some
        fashion, but don't head off to the tape backup storage closet
        just yet.</p><p>Instead, use the following recipe to attempt to
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">unwedge</span>â</span> your repository:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Make sure no processes are accessing (or

            This is important, as recovering a repository while
            running as the wrong user can tweak the permissions of the
            repository's files in such a way that your repository will
            still be inaccessible even after it is 
            <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">unwedged.</span>â</span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Run the command <strong class="userinput"><code>svnadmin recover

            this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

The latest repos revision is 19.
</pre></div><p>This command may take many minutes to complete.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Restart the server process.</p></li></ol></div><p>This procedure fixes almost every case of repository
        wedging.  Make sure that you run this command as the user that
        owns and manages the database, not just as
        <code class="literal">root</code>.  Part of the recovery process might
        involve re-creating from scratch various database files (shared
        memory regions, e.g.).  Recovering as
        <code class="literal">root</code> will create those files such that they
        are owned by <code class="literal">root</code>, which means that even
        after you restore connectivity to your repository, regular
        users will be unable to access it.</p><p>If the previous procedure, for some reason, does not
        successfully unwedge your repository, you should do two
        things.  First, move your broken repository directory aside
        (perhaps by renaming it to something like
        <code class="filename">repos.BROKEN</code>) and then restore your
        latest backup of it.  Then, send an email to the Subversion
        users mailing list (at <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:users@subversion.apache.org">users@subversion.apache.org</a>&gt;</code>)
        describing your problem in detail.  Data integrity is an
        extremely high priority to the Subversion developers.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate"></a>Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere</h3></div></div></div><p>A Subversion filesystem has its data spread throughout
        files in the repository, in a fashion generally
        understood by (and of interest to) only the Subversion
        developers themselves.  However, circumstances may arise that
        call for all, or some subset, of that data to be copied or
        moved into another repository.</p><p>Subversion provides such functionality by way of
        <em class="firstterm">repository dump streams</em>.  A repository
        dump stream (often referred to as a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">dump file</span>â</span>
        when stored as a file on disk) is a portable, flat file format
        that describes the various revisions in your
        repositoryâwhat was changed, by whom, when, and so on.
        This dump stream is the primary mechanism used to marshal
        versioned historyâin whole or in part, with or without
        modificationâbetween repositories.  And Subversion
        provides the tools necessary for creating and loading these
        dump streams: the <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> and
        <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span> subcommands, respectively,
        and the <span class="command"><strong>svnrdump</strong></span> program.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While the Subversion repository dump format contains
          human-readable portions and a familiar structure (it
          resembles an RFC 822 format, the same type of format used
          for most email), it is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a plain-text
          file format.  It is a binary file format, highly sensitive
          to meddling.  For example, many text editors will corrupt
          the file by automatically converting line endings.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>There are many reasons for dumping and loading Subversion
        repository data.  Early in Subversion's life, the most common
        reason was due to the evolution of Subversion itself.  As
        Subversion matured, there were times when changes made to the
        backend database schema caused compatibility issues with
        previous versions of the repository, so users had to dump
        their repository data using the previous version of
        Subversion and load it into a freshly created repository with
        the new version of Subversion.  Now, these types of schema
        changes haven't occurred since Subversion's 1.0 release, and
        the Subversion developers promise not to force users to dump
        and load their repositories when upgrading between minor
        versions (such as from 1.3 to 1.4) of Subversion.  But there
        are still other reasons for dumping and loading, including
        re-deploying a Berkeley DB repository on a new OS or CPU
        architecture, switching between the Berkeley DB and FSFS
        backends, or (as we'll cover later in this chapter in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.filtering" title="Filtering Repository History">the section called âFiltering Repository Historyâ</a>) purging versioned
        data from repository history.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The Subversion repository dump format describes
          versioned repository changes only.  It will not carry any
          information about uncommitted transactions, user locks on
          filesystem paths, repository or server configuration
          customizations (including hook scripts), and so on.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>The Subversion repository dump format also enables
        conversion from a different storage mechanism or version
        control system altogether.  Because the dump file format is,
        for the most part, human-readable, it should be relatively
        easy to describe generic sets of changesâeach of which
        should be treated as a new revisionâusing this file
        format.  In fact, the <span class="command"><strong>cvs2svn</strong></span> utility (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.forcvs.convert" title="Converting a Repository from CVS to Subversion">the section called âConverting a Repository from CVS to Subversionâ</a>) uses the dump format to
        represent the contents of a CVS repository so that those
        contents can be copied into a Subversion repository.</p><p>For now, we'll concern ourselves only with migration of
        repository data between Subversion repositories, which we'll
        describe in detail in the sections which follow.</p><div class="sect3" title="Repository data migration using svnadmin"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnadmin"></a>Repository data migration using svnadmin</h4></div></div></div><p>Whatever your reason for migrating repository history,
          using the <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span> subcommands is
          straightforward.  <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> will output
          a range of repository revisions that are formatted using
          Subversion's custom filesystem dump format.  The dump format
          is printed to the standard output stream, while informative
          messages are printed to the standard error stream.  This
          allows you to redirect the output stream to a file while
          watching the status output in your terminal window.  For
          example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnlook youngest myrepos

$ svnadmin dump myrepos &gt; dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
â¦
* Dumped revision 25.
* Dumped revision 26.
</pre></div><p>At the end of the process, you will have a single file
          (<code class="filename">dumpfile</code> in the previous example) that
          contains all the data stored in your repository in the
          requested range of revisions.  Note that <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
          dump</strong></span> is reading revision trees from the repository
          just like any other <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">reader</span>â</span> process would
          (e.g., <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>), so it's safe
          to run this command at any time.</p><p>The other subcommand in the pair, <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
          load</strong></span>, parses the standard input stream as a
          Subversion repository dump file and effectively replays those
          dumped revisions into the target repository for that
          operation.  It also gives informative feedback, this time
          using the standard output stream:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>The result of a load is new revisions added to a
          repositoryâthe same thing you get by making commits
          against that repository from a regular Subversion client.
          Just as in a commit, you can use hook programs to perform
          actions before and after each of the commits made during a
          load process.  By passing the
          <code class="option">--use-pre-commit-hook</code> and
          <code class="option">--use-post-commit-hook</code> options to
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span>, you can instruct Subversion
          to execute the pre-commit and post-commit hook programs,
          respectively, for each loaded revision.  You might use these,
          for example, to ensure that loaded revisions pass through the
          same validation steps that regular commits pass through.  Of
          course, you should use these options with careâif your
          post-commit hook sends emails to a mailing list for each new
          commit, you might not want to spew hundreds or thousands of
          commit emails in rapid succession at that list!  You can read
          more about the use of hook scripts in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks" title="Implementing Repository Hooks">the section called âImplementing Repository Hooksâ</a>.</p><p>Note that because <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> uses
          standard input and output streams for the repository dump and
          load processes, people who are feeling especially saucy can try
          things such as this (perhaps even using different versions of
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> on each side of the pipe):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin create newrepos
$ svnadmin dump oldrepos | svnadmin load newrepos
</pre></div><p>By default, the dump file will be quite largeâmuch
          larger than the repository itself.  That's because by default
          every version of every file is expressed as a full text in the
          dump file.  This is the fastest and simplest behavior, and
          it's nice if you're piping the dump data directly into some other
          process (such as a compression program, filtering program, or
          loading process).  But if you're creating a dump file
          for longer-term storage, you'll likely want to save disk space
          by using the <code class="option">--deltas</code> option.  With this
          option, successive revisions of files will be output as
          compressed, binary differencesâjust as file revisions
          are stored in a repository.  This option is slower, but it
          results in a dump file much closer in size to the original
          repository.</p><p>We mentioned previously that <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
          dump</strong></span> outputs a range of revisions.  Use the
          <code class="option">--revision</code> (<code class="option">-r</code>) option to
          specify a single revision, or a range of revisions, to dump.
          If you omit this option, all the existing repository revisions
          will be dumped.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 23 &gt; rev-23.dumpfile
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 100:200 &gt; revs-100-200.dumpfile
</pre></div><p>As Subversion dumps each new revision, it outputs only
          enough information to allow a future loader to re-create that
          revision based on the previous one.  In other words, for any
          given revision in the dump file, only the items that were
          changed in that revision will appear in the dump.  The only
          exception to this rule is the first revision that is dumped
          with the current <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span>
          command.</p><p>By default, Subversion will not express the first dumped
          revision as merely differences to be applied to the previous
          revision.  For one thing, there is no previous revision in the
          dump file!  And second, Subversion cannot know the state of
          the repository into which the dump data will be loaded (if it
          ever is).  To ensure that the output of each
          execution of <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> is
          self-sufficient, the first dumped revision is, by default, a
          full representation of every directory, file, and property in
          that revision of the repository.</p><p>However, you can change this default behavior.  If you add
          the <code class="option">--incremental</code> option when you dump your
          repository, <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin</strong></span> will compare the first
          dumped revision against the previous revision in the
          repositoryâthe same way it treats every other revision that
          gets dumped.  It will then output the first revision exactly
          as it does the rest of the revisions in the dump
          rangeâmentioning only the changes that occurred in that
          revision.  The benefit of this is that you can create several
          small dump files that can be loaded in succession, instead of
          one large one, like so:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 0:1000 &gt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 1001:2000 --incremental &gt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 2001:3000 --incremental &gt; dumpfile3
</pre></div><p>These dump files could be loaded into a new repository
          with the following command sequence:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile3
</pre></div><p>Another neat trick you can perform with this
          <code class="option">--incremental</code> option involves appending to an
          existing dump file a new range of dumped revisions.  For
          example, you might have a <code class="literal">post-commit</code> hook
          that simply appends the repository dump of the single revision
          that triggered the hook.  Or you might have a script that runs
          nightly to append dump file data for all the revisions that
          were added to the repository since the last time the script
          ran.  Used like this, <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> can be
          one way to back up changes to your repository over time in case
          of a system crash or some other catastrophic event.</p><p>The dump format can also be used to merge the contents of
          several different repositories into a single repository.  By
          using the <code class="option">--parent-dir</code> option of
          <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span>, you can specify a new
          virtual root directory for the load process.  That means if
          you have dump files for three repositoriesâsay
          <code class="filename">calc-dumpfile</code>,
          <code class="filename">cal-dumpfile</code>, and
          <code class="filename">ss-dumpfile</code>âyou can first create a new
          repository to hold them all:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/projects
$
</pre></div><p>Then, make new directories in the repository that will
          encapsulate the contents of each of the three previous
          repositories:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn mkdir -m "Initial project roots" \
            file:///var/svn/projects/calc \
            file:///var/svn/projects/calendar \
            file:///var/svn/projects/spreadsheet
Committed revision 1.
$ 
</pre></div><p>Lastly, load the individual dump files into their
          respective locations in the new repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calc &lt; calc-dumpfile
â¦
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calendar &lt; cal-dumpfile
â¦
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir spreadsheet &lt; ss-dumpfile
â¦

          specialized functionality, essentially as a network-aware

          and <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span> commands which we

          generate incremental dumps just as you might
          with <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span>.  You can even dump a
          subtree of the repositoryâsomething
          that <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> cannot do.</p><p>The primary difference is that instead of requiring
          direct access to the repository, <span class="command"><strong>svnrdump</strong></span>
          operates remotely, using the very same Repository Access
          (RA) protocols that the Subversion client does.  As such,
          you might need to provide authentication credentials.  Also,
          your remote interations are subject to any authorization
          limitations configured on the Subversion server.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="command"><strong>svnrdump dump</strong></span> requires that the

        the very least, binary differencing algorithms and data
        compression (optionally in a completely opaque database
        system), attempting manual tweaks is unwise if not quite
        difficult, and at any rate strongly discouraged.  And once
        data has been stored in your repository, Subversion generally
        doesn't provide an easy way to remove that
        data.<sup>[<a id="idp38623712" href="#ftn.idp38623712" class="footnote">45</a>]</sup>  But inevitably, there
        will be times when you would like to manipulate the history of
        your repository.  You might need to strip out all instances of
        a file that was accidentally added to the repository (and
        shouldn't be there for whatever
        reason).<sup>[<a id="idp38624528" href="#ftn.idp38624528" class="footnote">46</a>]</sup>  Or, perhaps you have multiple
        projects sharing a single repository, and you decide to split
        them up into their own repositories.  To accomplish tasks such
        as these, administrators need a more manageable and malleable
        representation of the data in their repositoriesâthe
        Subversion repository dump format.</p><p>As we described earlier in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate" title="Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere">the section called âMigrating Repository Data Elsewhereâ</a>, the Subversion
        repository dump format is a human-readable representation of
        the changes that you've made to your versioned data over time.
        Use the <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svnrdump
        dump</strong></span> command to generate the dump data,
        and <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin load</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svnrdump
        load</strong></span> to populate a new repository with it.  The
        great thing about the human-readability aspect of the dump
        format is that, if you aren't careless about it, you can
        manually inspect and modify it.  Of course, the downside is
        that if you have three years' worth of repository activity
        encapsulated in what is likely to be a very large dump file,
        it could take you a long, long time to manually inspect and
        modify it.</p><p>That's where <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter</strong></span> becomes
        useful.  This program acts as a path-based filter for
        repository dump streams.  Simply give it either a list of
        paths you wish to keep or a list of paths you wish to not
        keep, and then pipe your repository dump data through this
        filter.  The result will be a modified stream of dump data
        that contains only the versioned paths you (explicitly or
        implicitly) requested.</p><p>Let's look at a realistic example of how you might use this
        program.  Earlier in this chapter (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="Planning Your Repository Organization">the section called âPlanning Your Repository Organizationâ</a>), we discussed the
        process of deciding how to choose a layout for the data in
        your repositoriesâusing one repository per project or
        combining them, arranging stuff within your repository, and
        so on.  But sometimes after new revisions start flying in,
        you rethink your layout and would like to make some changes.
        A common change is the decision to move multiple projects
        that are sharing a single repository into separate
        repositories for each project.</p><p>Our imaginary repository contains three projects:
        <code class="literal">calc</code>, <code class="literal">calendar</code>, and
        <code class="literal">spreadsheet</code>.  They have been living
        side-by-side in a layout like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>
/<br></br>
Â Â Â calc/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â branches/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â tags/<br></br>
Â Â Â calendar/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â branches/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â tags/<br></br>
Â Â Â spreadsheet/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â trunk/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â branches/<br></br>
Â Â Â Â Â Â tags/<br></br>
</p></div></div><p>To get these three projects into their own repositories,
        we first dump the whole repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos &gt; repos-dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
* Dumped revision 3.
â¦
$
</pre></div><p>Next, run that dump file through the filter, each time
        including only one of our top-level directories.  This results
        in three new dump files:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svndumpfilter include calc &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; calc-dumpfile
â¦
$ svndumpfilter include calendar &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; cal-dumpfile
â¦
$ svndumpfilter include spreadsheet &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; ss-dumpfile
â¦
$
</pre></div><p>At this point, you have to make a decision.  Each of your
        dump files will create a valid repository, but will preserve
        the paths exactly as they were in the original repository.
        This means that even though you would have a repository solely
        for your <code class="literal">calc</code> project, that repository
        would still have a top-level directory named
        <code class="filename">calc</code>.  If you want your
        <code class="filename">trunk</code>, <code class="filename">tags</code>, and
        <code class="filename">branches</code> directories to live in the root
        of your repository, you might wish to edit your dump files,
        tweaking the <code class="literal">Node-path</code> and
        <code class="literal">Node-copyfrom-path</code> headers so that they no
        longer have that first <code class="filename">calc/</code> path
        component.  Also, you'll want to remove the section of dump
        data that creates the <code class="filename">calc</code> directory.  It
        will look something like the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
Node-path: calc
Node-action: add
Node-kind: dir
Content-length: 0
  
</pre></div><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>If you do plan on manually editing the dump file to
          remove a top-level directory, make sure your editor is
          not set to automatically convert end-of-line characters to
          the native format (e.g., <code class="literal">\r\n</code> to
          <code class="literal">\n</code>), as the content will then not agree
          with the metadata.  This will render the dump file
          useless.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>All that remains now is to create your three new
        repositories, and load each dump file into the right
        repository, ignoring the UUID found in the dump stream:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin create calc
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid calc &lt; calc-dumpfile

        accept options for deciding how to deal with
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">empty</span>â</span> revisions.  If a given revision
        contains only changes to paths that were filtered out, that

              there are no gaps in the numeric sequence.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">--preserve-revprops</code></span></dt><dd><p>If empty revisions are not dropped, preserve the
              revision properties (log message, author, date, custom
              properties, etc.) for those empty revisions.
              Otherwise, empty revisions will contain only the
              original datestamp, and a generated log message that

        <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter exclude</strong></span> (and if they don't,
        you shouldn't).  Further, if your dump file has an
        inconsistent usage of leading slashes for some
        reason,<sup>[<a id="idp38671280" href="#ftn.idp38671280" class="footnote">47</a>]</sup> you should probably normalize
        those paths so that they all have, or all lack, leading
        slashes.</p><p>Also, copied paths can give you some trouble.
        Subversion supports copy operations in the repository, where
        a new path is created by copying some already existing path.
        It is possible that at some point in the lifetime of your
        repository, you might have copied a file or directory from
        some location that <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter</strong></span> is
        excluding, to a location that it is including.  To
        make the dump data self-sufficient,
        <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter</strong></span> needs to still show the
        addition of the new pathâincluding the contents of any
        files created by the copyâand not represent that
        addition as a copy from a source that won't exist in your
        filtered dump data stream.  But because the Subversion
        repository dump format shows only what was changed in each
        revision, the contents of the copy source might not be
        readily available.  If you suspect that you have any copies
        of this sort in your repository, you might want to rethink
        your set of included/excluded paths, perhaps including the
        paths that served as sources of your troublesome copy
        operations, too.</p><p>Finally, <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter</strong></span> takes path
        filtering quite literally.  If you are trying to copy the
        history of a project rooted at
        <code class="filename">trunk/my-project</code> and move it into a
        repository of its own, you would, of course, use the
        <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter include</strong></span> command to keep all
        the changes in and under
        <code class="filename">trunk/my-project</code>.  But the resultant
        dump file makes no assumptions about the repository into
        which you plan to load this data.  Specifically, the dump
        data might begin with the revision that added the
        <code class="filename">trunk/my-project</code> directory, but it will
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> contain directives that would
        create the <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory itself
        (because <code class="filename">trunk</code> doesn't match the
        include filter).  You'll need to make sure that any
        directories that the new dump stream expects to exist
        actually do exist in the target repository before trying to
        load the stream into that repository.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Repository Replication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication"></a>Repository Replication</h3></div></div></div><p>There are several scenarios in which it is quite handy to
        have a Subversion repository whose version history is exactly
        the same as some other repository's.  Perhaps the most obvious
        one is the maintenance of a simple backup repository, used
        when the primary repository has become inaccessible due to a
        hardware failure, network outage, or other such annoyance.
        Other scenarios include deploying mirror repositories to
        distribute heavy Subversion load across multiple servers, use
        as a soft-upgrade mechanism, and so on.</p><p>Subversion provides a program for managing scenarios such
        as these.  <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> works by essentially
        asking the Subversion server to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">replay</span>â</span>
        revisions, one at a time.  It then uses that revision
        information to mimic a commit of the same to another
        repository.  Neither repository needs to be locally accessible
        to the machine on which <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> is
        runningâits parameters are repository URLs, and it does
        all its work through Subversion's Repository Access (RA)
        interfaces.  All it requires is read access to the source
        repository and read/write access to the destination
        repository.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>When using <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> against a remote

          like to mirror, the next thing you need is a target repository
          that will actually serve as that mirror.  This target
          repository can use either of the available filesystem
          data-store backends (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends" title="Choosing a Data Store">the section called âChoosing a Data Storeâ</a>)âSubversion's abstraction layers ensure that such
          details don't matter.  But by default, it must
          not yet have any version history in it.  (We'll discuss an
          exception to this later in this section.)</p><p>The protocol that <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> uses to
          communicate revision information is highly sensitive to
          mismatches between the versioned histories contained in the

          in a somewhat typical mirroring scenario.  We'll pepper this
          discourse with practical recommendations, which you are free to
          disregard if they aren't required by or suitable for your
          environment.</p><p>We will be mirroring the public Subversion repository
          which houses the source code for this very book and exposing
          that mirror publicly on the Internet, hosted on a different
          machine than the one on which the original Subversion source
          code repository lives.  This remote host has a global
          configuration that permits anonymous users to read the
          contents of repositories on the host, but requires users to
          authenticate to modify those repositories.  (Please forgive
          us for glossing over the details of Subversion server
          configuration for the momentâthose are covered
          thoroughly in <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig" title="ChapterÂ 6.Â Server Configuration">ChapterÂ 6, <em>Server Configuration</em></a>.)  And for
          no other reason than that it makes for a more interesting
          example, we'll be driving the replication process from a
          third machineâthe one that we currently find ourselves
          using.</p><p>First, we'll create the repository which will be our
          mirror.  This and the next couple of steps do require shell
          access to the machine on which the mirror repository will
          live.  Once the repository is all configured, though, we
          shouldn't need to touch it directly again.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ ssh admin@svn.example.com "svnadmin create /var/svn/svn-mirror"

</pre></div><p>At this point, we have our repository, and due to our
          server's configuration, that repository is now
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">live</span>â</span> on the Internet.  Now, because we don't
          want anything modifying the repository except our replication
          process, we need a way to distinguish that process from other
          would-be committers.  To do so, we use a dedicated username
          for our process.  Only commits and revision property
          modifications performed by the special username
          <code class="literal">syncuser</code> will be allowed.</p><p>We'll use the repository's hook system both to allow the
          replication process to do what it needs to do and to enforce
          that only it is doing those things.  We accomplish this by
          implementing two of the repository event
          hooksâpre-revprop-change and start-commit.  Our
          <code class="filename">pre-revprop-change</code> hook script is found
          in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.pre-revprop-change" title="ExampleÂ 5.2.Â Mirror repository's pre-revprop-change hook script">ExampleÂ 5.2, âMirror repository's pre-revprop-change hook scriptâ</a>, and basically verifies that the user attempting the
          property changes is our <code class="literal">syncuser</code> user.  If
          so, the change is allowed; otherwise, it is denied.</p><div class="example"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.pre-revprop-change"></a><p class="title"><strong>ExampleÂ 5.2.Â Mirror repository's pre-revprop-change hook script</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

          ensure that only the <code class="literal">syncuser</code> user is
          permitted to commit new revisions to the repository.  We do
          this using a <code class="filename">start-commit</code> hook script

          initialize</strong></span> subcommand.  The URLs we provide point
          to the root directories of the target and source
          repositories, respectively.  In Subversion 1.4, this is
          requiredâonly full mirroring of repositories is
          permitted.  Beginning with Subversion 1.5, though, you can
          use <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> to mirror only some subtree

            Occasionally, though, if a synchronization fails

            synchronization attempts to fail because it appears that a
            synchronization is still in progress when, in fact, none is.
            Fortunately, recovering from this situation is easy to do.

            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>'s commands.  In previous
            Subversion versions, you need only to remove the
            <code class="literal">svn:sync-lock</code> property which serves as
            this flag from revision 0 of the mirror repository:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propdel --revprop -r0 svn:sync-lock http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
property 'svn:sync-lock' deleted from repository revision 0
$
</pre></div><p>Also, <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> stores the source
            repository URL provided at mirror initialization time in a
            bookkeeping property on the mirror repository.  Future
            synchronization operations against that mirror which omit
            the source URL at the command line will consult the
            special <code class="literal">svn:sync-from-url</code> property
            stored on the mirror itself to know where to synchronize
            from.  This value is used literally by the synchronization
            process, though.  Be wary of using non-fully-qualified
            domain names (such as referring
            to <code class="literal">svnbook.red-bean.com</code> as
            simply <code class="literal">svnbook</code> because that happens to
            work when you are connected directly to
            the <code class="literal">red-bean.com</code> network), domain names
            which don't resolve or resolve differently depending on
            where you happen to be operating from, or IP addresses
            (which can change over time).  But here again, if you need
            an existing mirror to start referring to a different URL
            for the same source repository, you can change the
            bookkeeping property which houses that information.  Users
            of Subversion 1.7 or better can use <span class="command"><strong>svnsync init
            --allow-non-empty</strong></span> to reinitialize their mirrors
            with new source URL:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnsync initialize --allow-non-empty http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror \
                                       <em class="replaceable"><code>NEW-SOURCE-URL</code></em>
Copied properties for revision 4065.
$
</pre></div><p>If you are running an older version of Subversion,
            you'll need to manually tweak
            the <code class="literal">svn:sync-from-url</code> bookkeeping
            property:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn propset --revprop -r0 svn:sync-from-url <em class="replaceable"><code>NEW-SOURCE-URL</code></em> \
      http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
property 'svn:sync-from-url' set on repository revision 0
$
</pre></div><p>Another interesting thing about these special
            bookkeeping properties is that <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>
            will not attempt to mirror any of those properties when they
            are found in the source repository.  The reason is probably
            obvious, but basically boils down to
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> not being able to distinguish the
            special properties it has merely copied from the source
            repository from those it needs to consult and maintain for
            its own bookkeeping needs.  This situation could occur if,
            for example, you were maintaining a mirror of a mirror of a
            third repository.  When <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> sees its
            own special properties in revision 0 of the source
            repository, it simply ignores them.</p><p>An <span class="command"><strong>svnsync info</strong></span> subcommand was
            added in Subversion 1.6 to easily display the special
            bookkeeping properties in the destination
            repository.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          Because Subversion revision properties can be changed at any
          time throughout the lifetime of the repository, and because
          they don't leave an audit trail that indicates when they were
          changed, replication processes have to pay special attention
          to them.  If you've already mirrored the first 15 revisions of
          a repository and someone then changes a revision property on
          revision 12, <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> won't know to go back
          and patch up its copy of revision 12.  You'll need to tell it
          to do so manually by using (or with some additional tooling
          around) the <span class="command"><strong>svnsync copy-revprops</strong></span>
          subcommand, which simply rereplicates all the revision
          properties for a particular revision or range thereof.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          via <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> in a nutshell.  You'll likely
          want some automation around such a process.  For example,
          while our example was a pull-and-push setup, you might wish to
          have your primary repository push changes to one or more
          blessed mirrors as part of its post-commit and
          post-revprop-change hook implementations.  This would enable
          the mirror to be up to date in as near to real time as is
          likely possible.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Partial replication with svnsync"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.svnsync-partial"></a>Partial replication with svnsync</h4></div></div></div><p><span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> isn't limited to full copies
          of everything which lives in a repository.  It can handle
          various shades of partial replication, too.  For example,
          while it isn't very commonplace to do so,
          <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> does gracefully mirror repositories
          in which the user as whom it authenticates has only partial
          read access.  It simply copies only the bits of the repository
          that it is permitted to see.  Obviously, such a mirror is not
          useful as a backup solution.</p><p>As of Subversion 1.5, <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> also
          has the ability to mirror a subset of a repository rather than
          the whole thing.  The process of setting up and maintaining
          such a mirror is exactly the same as when mirroring a whole
          repository, except that instead of specifying the source
          repository's root URL when running <span class="command"><strong>svnsync
          init</strong></span>, you specify the URL of some subdirectory
          within that repository.  Synchronization to that mirror will
          now copy only the bits that changed under that source
          repository subdirectory.  There are some limitations to this
          support, though.  First, you can't mirror multiple disjoint
          subdirectories of the source repository into a single mirror
          repositoryâyou'd need to instead mirror some parent
          directory that is common to both.  Second, the filtering
          logic is entirely path-based, so if the subdirectory you are
          mirroring was renamed at some point in the past, your mirror
          would contain only the revisions since the directory appeared
          at the URL you specified.  And likewise, if the source
          subdirectory is renamed in the future, your synchronization
          processes will stop mirroring data at the point that the
          source URL you specified is no longer valid.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="A quick trick for mirror creation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.svnsync-init-nonempty"></a>A quick trick for mirror creation</h4></div></div></div><p>We mentioned previously the cost of setting up an
          initial mirror of an existing repository.  For many folks,
          the sheer cost of transmitting thousandsâor
          millionsâof revisions of history to a new mirror
          repository via <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> is a show-stopper.
          Fortunately, Subversion 1.7 provides a workaround by way of
          a new <code class="option">--allow-non-empty</code> option to
          <span class="command"><strong>svnsync initialize</strong></span>.  This option allows
          you to initialize one repository as a mirror of another
          while bypassing the verification that the to-be-initialized
          mirror has no version history present in it.  Per our
          previous warnings about the sensitivity of this whole
          replication process, you should rightly discern that this is
          an option to be used only with great caution.  But it's
          wonderfully handy when you have administrative access to the
          source repository, where you can simply make a physical copy
          of the repository and then initialize that copy as a new
          mirror:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

          history from one repository to another.  So let's look now
          at the user end of these operations.  How does replication
          and the various situations which call for it affect
          Subversion clients?</p><p>As far as user interaction with repositories and mirrors
          goes, it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> possible to have a single
          working copy that interacts with both, but you'll have to
          jump through some hoops to make it happen.  First, you need
          to ensure that both the primary and mirror repositories have
          the same repository UUID (which is not the case by default).
          See <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids" title="Managing Repository UUIDs">the section called âManaging Repository UUIDsâ</a> later in
          this chapter for more about this.</p><p>Once the two repositories have the same UUID, you can use
          <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> to point your working
          copy to whichever of the repositories you wish to operate
          against, a process that is described in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svn.c.relocate" title="svn relocate">svn relocate</a> in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Subversion Complete Reference">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Subversion Complete Reference</em></a>.  There is a possible danger here,
          though, in that if the primary and mirror repositories
          aren't in close synchronization, a working copy up to date
          with, and pointing to, the primary repository will, if
          relocated to point to an out-of-date mirror, become confused
          about the apparent sudden loss of revisions it fully expects
          to be present, and it will throw errors to that effect.  If
          this occurs, you can relocate your working copy back to the
          primary repository and then either wait until the mirror
          repository is up to date, or backdate your working copy to a
          revision you know is present in the sync repository, and
          then retry the relocation.</p><p>Finally, be aware that the revision-based replication
          provided by <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> is only
          thatâreplication of revisions.  Only the kinds of
          information carried by the Subversion repository dump file
          format are available for replication.  As such, tools such
          as <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>
          (and <span class="command"><strong>svnrdump</strong></span>, which we discuss in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate.svnrdump" title="Repository data migration using svnrdump">the section called âRepository data migration using svnrdumpâ</a>)
          are limited in ways similar to that of the repository dump
          stream.  They do not include in their replicated information
          such things as the hook implementations, repository or
          server configuration data, uncommitted transactions, or
          information about user locks on repository paths.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Repository Backup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.backup"></a>Repository Backup</h3></div></div></div><p>Despite numerous advances in technology since the birth of
        the modern computer, one thing unfortunately rings true with
        crystalline clarityâsometimes things go very, very
        awry.  Power outages, network connectivity dropouts, corrupt
        RAM, and crashed hard drives are but a taste of the evil that
        Fate is poised to unleash on even the most conscientious
        administrator.  And so we arrive at a very important
        topicâhow to make backup copies of your repository
        data.</p><p>There are two types of backup methods available for
        Subversion repository administratorsâfull and
        incremental.  A full backup of the repository involves
        squirreling away in one sweeping action all the information
        required to fully reconstruct that repository in the event of
        a catastrophe.  Usually, it means, quite literally, the
        duplication of the entire repository directory (which includes
        either a Berkeley DB or FSFS environment).  Incremental
        backups are lesser things:  backups of only the portion of the
        repository data that has changed since the previous
        backup.</p><p>As far as full backups go, the naÃ¯ve approach might seem
        like a sane one, but unless you temporarily disable all other
        access to your repository, simply doing a recursive directory
        copy runs the risk of generating a faulty backup.  In the case
        of Berkeley DB, the documentation describes a certain order in
        which database files can be copied that will guarantee a valid
        backup copy.  A similar ordering exists for FSFS data.  But
        you don't have to implement these algorithms yourself, because
        the Subversion development team has already done so.  The
        <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin hotcopy</strong></span> command takes care of the
        minutia involved in making a hot backup of your repository.
        And its invocation is as trivial as the Unix
        <span class="command"><strong>cp</strong></span> or Windows <span class="command"><strong>copy</strong></span>
        operations:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin hotcopy /var/svn/repos /var/svn/repos-backup
</pre></div><p>The resultant backup is a fully functional Subversion
        repository, able to be dropped in as a replacement for your
        live repository should something go horribly wrong.</p><p>When making copies of a Berkeley DB repository, you can
        even instruct <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin hotcopy</strong></span> to purge any
        unused Berkeley DB logfiles (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.bdblogs" title="Purging unused Berkeley DB logfiles">the section called âPurging unused Berkeley DB logfilesâ</a>) from the
        original repository upon completion of the copy.  Simply
        provide the <code class="option">--clean-logs</code> option on the
        command line.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin hotcopy --clean-logs /var/svn/bdb-repos /var/svn/bdb-repos-backup
</pre></div><p>Additional tooling around this command is available, too.
        The <code class="filename">tools/backup/</code> directory of the
        Subversion source distribution holds the
        <span class="command"><strong>hot-backup.py</strong></span> script.  This script adds a
        bit of backup management atop <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
        hotcopy</strong></span>, allowing you to keep only the most recent
        configured number of backups of each repository.  It will
        automatically manage the names of the backed-up repository
        directories to avoid collisions with previous backups and
        will <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">rotate off</span>â</span> older backups, deleting them so
        that only the most recent ones remain.  Even if you also have an
        incremental backup, you might want to run this program on a
        regular basis.  For example, you might consider using
        <span class="command"><strong>hot-backup.py</strong></span> from a program scheduler
        (such as <span class="command"><strong>cron</strong></span> on Unix systems), which can
        cause it to run nightly (or at whatever granularity of time
        you deem safe).</p><p>Some administrators use a different backup mechanism built
        around generating and storing repository dump data.  We
        described in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate" title="Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere">the section called âMigrating Repository Data Elsewhereâ</a>
        how to use <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> with
        the <code class="option">--incremental</code> option to perform an
        incremental backup of a given revision or range of revisions.
        And of course, you can achieve a full backup variation of this
        by omitting the <code class="option">--incremental</code> option to that
        command.  There is some value in these methods, in that the
        format of your backed-up information is flexibleâit's
        not tied to a particular platform, versioned filesystem type,
        or release of Subversion or Berkeley DB.  But that flexibility
        comes at a cost, namely that restoring that data can take a
        long timeâlonger with each new revision committed to
        your repository.  Also, as is the case with so many of the
        various backup methods, revision property changes that are
        made to already backed-up revisions won't get picked up by a
        nonoverlapping, incremental dump generation.  For these
        reasons, we recommend against relying solely on dump-based
        backup approaches.</p><p>As you can see, each of the various backup types and
        methods has its advantages and disadvantages.  The easiest is
        by far the full hot backup, which will always result in a
        perfect working replica of your repository.  Should something
        bad happen to your live repository, you can restore from the
        backup with a simple recursive directory copy.  Unfortunately,
        if you are maintaining multiple backups of your repository,
        these full copies will each eat up just as much disk space as
        your live repository.  Incremental backups, by contrast, tend
        to be quicker to generate and smaller to store.  But the
        restoration process can be a pain, often involving applying
        multiple incremental backups.  And other methods have their
        own peculiarities.  Administrators need to find the balance
        between the cost of making the backup and the cost of
        restoring it.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> program (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.replication" title="Repository Replication">the section called âRepository Replicationâ</a>) actually
        provides a rather handy middle-ground approach.  If you are
        regularly synchronizing a read-only mirror with your main
        repository, in a pinch your read-only mirror is probably
        a good candidate for replacing that main repository if it
        falls over.  The primary disadvantage of this method is that
        only the versioned repository data gets
        synchronizedârepository configuration files,
        user-specified repository path locks, and other items that
        might live in the physical repository directory but not
        <span class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the repository's virtual versioned
        filesystem are not handled by <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>.</p><p>In any backup scenario, repository administrators need to
        be aware of how modifications to unversioned revision
        properties affect their backups.  Since these changes do not
        themselves generate new revisions, they will not trigger
        post-commit hooks, and may not even trigger the
        pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change
        hooks.<sup>[<a id="idp38839376" href="#ftn.idp38839376" class="footnote">50</a>]</sup>  And since you can change
        revision properties without respect to chronological
        orderâyou can change any revision's properties at any
        timeâan incremental backup of the latest few revisions
        might not catch a property modification to a revision that was
        included as part of a previous backup.</p><p>Generally speaking, only the truly paranoid would need to
        back up their entire repository, say, every time a commit
        occurred.  However, assuming that a given repository has some
        other redundancy mechanism in place with relatively fine
        granularity (such as per-commit emails or incremental dumps), a
        hot backup of the database might be something that a
        repository administrator would want to include as part of a
        system-wide nightly backup.  It's your dataâprotect it
        as much as you'd like.</p><p>Often, the best approach to repository backups is a
        diversified one that leverages combinations of the methods
        described here.  The Subversion developers, for example, back
        up the Subversion source code repository nightly using
        <span class="command"><strong>hot-backup.py</strong></span> and an off-site
        <span class="command"><strong>rsync</strong></span> of those full backups; keep multiple
        archives of all the commit and property change notification
        emails; and have repository mirrors maintained by various
        volunteers using <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>.  Your solution
        might be similar, but should be catered to your needs and that
        delicate balance of convenience with paranoia.  And whatever
        you do, validate your backups from time to timeâwhat
        good is a spare tire that has a hole in it?  While all of this
        might not save your hardware from the iron fist of
        Fate,<sup>[<a id="idp38841952" href="#ftn.idp38841952" class="footnote">51</a>]</sup> it
        should certainly help you recover from those trying
        times.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Managing Repository UUIDs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids"></a>Managing Repository UUIDs</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion repositories have a universally unique
        identifier (UUID) associated with them.  This is used by
        Subversion clients to verify the identity of a repository when
        other forms of verification aren't good enough (such as
        checking the repository URL, which can change over time).
        Most Subversion repository administrators rarely, if ever,
        need to think about repository UUIDs as anything more than a
        trivial implementation detail of Subversion.  Sometimes,
        however, there is cause for attention to this detail.</p><p>As a general rule, you want the UUIDs of your live
        repositories to be unique.  That is, after all, the point of
        having UUIDs.  But there are times when you want the
        repository UUIDs of two repositories to be exactly the same.
        For example, if you make a copy of a repository for backup
        purposes, you want the backup to be a perfect replica of the
        original so that, in the event that you have to restore that
        backup and replace the live repository, users don't suddenly
        see what looks like a different repository.  When dumping and
        loading repository history (as described earlier in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate" title="Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere">the section called âMigrating Repository Data Elsewhereâ</a>), you get to decide
        whether to apply the UUID encapsulated in the data dump
        stream to the repository in which you are loading the data.  The
        particular circumstance will dictate the correct
        behavior.</p><p>There are a couple of ways to set (or reset) a
        repository's UUID, should you need to.  As of Subversion 1.5,
        this is as simple as using the <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin
        setuuid</strong></span> command.  If you provide this subcommand
        with an explicit UUID, it will validate that the UUID is
        well-formed and then set the repository UUID to that value.
        If you omit the UUID, a brand-new UUID will be generated for
        your repository.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos   # generate a new UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
3c3c38fe-acc0-11dc-acbc-1b37ff1c8e7c
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos \
           cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec  # restore the old UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$
</pre></div><p>For folks using versions of Subversion earlier than 1.5,
        these tasks are a little more complicated.  You can explicitly
        set a repository's UUID by piping a repository dump file stub
        that carries the new UUID specification through
        <strong class="userinput"><code>svnadmin load --force-uuid
        <em class="replaceable"><code>REPOS-PATH</code></em></code></strong>.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnadmin load --force-uuid /var/svn/repos &lt;&lt;EOF

$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$
</pre></div><p>Having older versions of Subversion generate a brand-new
        UUID is not quite as simple to do, though.  Your best bet here
        is to find some other way to generate a UUID, and then
        explicitly set the repository's UUID to that value.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Moving and Removing Repositories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.reposadmin.maint.moving-and-removing"></a>Moving and Removing Repositories</h2></div></div></div><p>Subversion repository data is wholly contained within the
      repository directory.  As such, you can move a Subversion
      repository to some other location on disk, rename a repository,
      copy a repository, or delete a repository altogether using the
      tools provided by your operating system for manipulating
      directoriesâ<span class="command"><strong>mv</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>cp
      -a</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>rm -r</strong></span> on Unix platforms;
      <span class="command"><strong>copy</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>move</strong></span>, and
      <span class="command"><strong>rmdir /s /q</strong></span> on Windows; vast numbers of mouse
      and menu gyrations in various graphical file explorer
      applications, and so on.</p><p>Of course, there's often still more to be done when trying
      to cleanly affect changes such as this.  For example, you might
      need to update your Subversion server configuration to point to
      the new location of a relocated repository or to remove
      configuration bits for a now-deleted repository.  If you have
      automated processes that publish information from or about your
      repositories, they may need to be updated.  Hook scripts might
      need to be reconfigured.  Users may need to be notified.  The list
      can go on indefinitely, or at least to the extent that you've
      built processes and procedures around your Subversion
      repository.</p><p>In the case of a copied repository, you should also consider
      the fact that Subversion uses repository UUIDs to distinguish
      repositories.  If you copy a Subversion repository using a
      typical shell recursive copy command, you'll wind up with two
      repositories that are identical in every wayâincluding
      their UUIDs.  In some circumstances, this might be desirable.
      But in the instances where it is not, you'll need to generate a
      new UUID for one of these identical repositories.  See
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids" title="Managing Repository UUIDs">the section called âManaging Repository UUIDsâ</a> for more about

accessed simultaneously by
    clients running on the same machine on which the repository
    resides using URLs carrying the <code class="literal">file://</code> scheme.
    But the typical Subversion setup involves a single server machine
    being accessed from clients on computers all over the
    officeâor, perhaps, all over the world.</p><p>This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository
    exposed outside its host machine for use by remote clients.  We
    will cover Subversion's currently available server mechanisms,
    discussing the configuration and use of each.  After reading this
    chapter, you should be able to decide which networking setup is
    right for your needs, as well as understand how to enable such a
    setup on your host computer.</p><div class="sect1" title="Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.serverconfig.overview"></a>Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>Subversion was designed with an abstract repository access layer.
      This means that a repository can be programmatically accessed by
      any sort of server process, and the client <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">repository
      access</span>â</span> API allows programmers to write plug-ins that
      speak relevant network protocols.  In theory, Subversion can use
      an infinite number of network implementations.  In practice,
      there are only two Subversion servers in widespread use today.</p><p>Apache is an extremely popular web server; using the
      <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module, Apache can access a
      repository and make it available to clients via the
      WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an extension of HTTP.  Because
      Apache is an extremely extensible server, it provides a number
      of features <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">for free,</span>â</span> such as encrypted SSL
      communication, logging, integration with a number of third-party
      authentication systems, and limited built-in web browsing of
      repositories.</p><p>In the other corner is <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>: a small,
      lightweight server program that speaks a custom protocol with
      clients.  Because its protocol is explicitly designed for
      Subversion and is stateful (unlike HTTP), it provides
      significantly faster network operationsâbut at the cost of
      some features as well.  While it can use SASL to provide a
      variety of authentication and encryption options, it has no
      logging or built-in web browsing.  It is, however, extremely
      easy to set up and is often the best option for small teams just
      starting out with Subversion.</p><p>The network protocol which <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
      speaks may also be tunneled over an SSH connection.  This
      deployment option for <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> differs quite
      a bit in features from a traditional <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
      deployment.  SSH is used to encrypt all communication.  SSH is
      also used exclusively to authenticate, so real system accounts
      are required on the server host (unlike
      vanilla <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, which has its own private
      user accounts).  Finally, because this setup requires that each
      user spawn a private, temporary <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
      process, it's equivalent (from a permissions point of view) to
      allowing a group of local users to all access the repository
      via <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs.  Path-based access control
      has no meaning, since each user is accessing the repository
      database files directly.</p><p><a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.overview.tbl-1" title="TableÂ 6.1.Â Comparison of subversion server options">TableÂ 6.1, âComparison of subversion server optionsâ</a> provides a

        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> installation for small teams just
        trying to get started with a Subversion server; it's the
        simplest to set up and has the fewest maintenance issues.
        You can always switch to a more complex server
        deployment as your needs change.</p><p>Here are some general recommendations and tips, based on
        years of supporting users:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>If you're trying to set up the simplest possible server
            for your group, a vanilla <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
            installation is the easiest, fastest route.  Note,
            however, that your repository data will be transmitted in
            the clear over the network.  If your deployment is
            entirely within your company's LAN or VPN, this isn't an
            issue.  If the repository is exposed to the wide-open
            Internet, you might want to make sure that either the
            repository's contents aren't sensitive (e.g., it contains
            only open source code), or that you go the extra mile in
            configuring SASL to encrypt network communications.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you need to integrate with existing legacy identity
            systems (LDAP, Active Directory, NTLM, X.509, etc.),
            you must use either the Apache-based server
            or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> configured with SASL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you've decided to use either Apache or stock
            <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, create a single
            <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> user on your system and run the
            server process as that user.  Be sure to make the
            repository directory wholly owned by the
            <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> user as well.  From a security
            point of view, this keeps the repository data nicely
            siloed and protected by operating system filesystem
            permissions, changeable by only the Subversion server
            process itself.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you have an existing infrastructure that is heavily based
            on SSH accounts, and if your users already have system
            accounts on your server machine, it makes sense to
            deploy an <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>-over-SSH solution.
            Otherwise, we don't widely recommend this option to the
            public.  It's generally considered safer to have your
            users access the repository via (imaginary) accounts
            managed by <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> or Apache, rather
            than by full-blown system accounts.  If your deep desire
            for encrypted communication still draws you to this
            option, we recommend using Apache with SSL or
            <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with SASL encryption
            instead.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be seduced by the simple
            idea of having all of your users access a repository
            directly via <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs.  Even if the
            repository is readily available to everyone via a network
            share, this is a bad idea.  It removes any layers of
            protection between the users and the repository: users can
            accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt the repository
            database, it becomes hard to take the repository offline
            for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a mess of
            file permission problems (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.multimethod" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ</a>).  Note that this
            is also one of the reasons we warn against accessing
            repositories via <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>
            URLsâfrom a security standpoint, it's effectively
            the same as local users accessing via
            <code class="literal">file://</code>, and it can entail all the same
            problems if the administrator isn't careful.</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="svnserve, a Custom Server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve"></a>svnserve, a Custom Server</h2></div></div></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program is a lightweight
      server, capable of speaking to clients over TCP/IP using a

      the <code class="literal">svn://</code> or <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>
      scheme.  This section will explain the different ways of running

        deployment options for <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.</p><div class="sect3" title="svnserve as daemon"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.daemon"></a>svnserve as daemon</h4></div></div></div><p>The easiest option is to run <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          as a standalone <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">daemon</span>â</span> process.  Use the
          <code class="option">-d</code> option for this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -d
$               # svnserve is now running, listening on port 3690
</pre></div><p>When running <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> in daemon mode,
          you can use the <code class="option">--listen-port</code> and
          <code class="option">--listen-host</code> options to customize the
          exact port and hostname to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">bind</span>â</span> to.</p><p>Once we successfully start <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          as explained previously, it makes every repository on your
          system available to the network.  A client needs to specify
          an <span class="emphasis"><em>absolute</em></span> path in the repository URL.
          For example, if a repository is located at
          <code class="filename">/var/svn/project1</code>, a client would reach
          it via <code class="uri">svn://host.example.com/var/svn/project1</code>.
          To increase security, you can pass the <code class="option">-r</code>
          option to <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, which restricts it to
          exporting only repositories below that path.  For
          example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -d -r /var/svn
â¦
</pre></div><p>Using the <code class="option">-r</code> option effectively
          modifies the location that the program treats as the root of
          the remote filesystem space.  Clients then use URLs that
          have that path portion removed from them, leaving much
          shorter (and much less revealing) URLs:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout svn://host.example.com/project1
â¦
</pre></div></div><div class="sect3" title="svnserve via inetd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.inetd"></a>svnserve via inetd</h4></div></div></div><p>If you want <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> to launch the
          process, you need to pass the <code class="option">-i</code>
          (<code class="option">--inetd</code>) option.  In the following
          example, we've shown the output from running
          <code class="literal">svnserve -i</code> at the command line, but note
          that this isn't how you actually start the daemon; see the
          paragraphs following the example for how to configure
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> to start
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -i
( success ( 2 2 ( ) ( edit-pipeline svndiff1 absent-entries commit-revprops d\
epth log-revprops atomic-revprops partial-replay ) ) )
</pre></div><p>When invoked with the <code class="option">--inetd</code> option,
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> attempts to speak with a
          Subversion client via <code class="filename">stdin</code> and
          <code class="filename">stdout</code> using a custom protocol.  This
          is the standard behavior for a program being run via
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span>.  The IANA has reserved port 3690
          for the Subversion protocol, so on a Unix-like system you
          can add lines to <code class="filename">/etc/services</code> such as
          these (if they don't already exist):</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
svn           3690/tcp   # Subversion
svn           3690/udp   # Subversion
</pre></div><p>If your system is using a classic Unix-like
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> daemon, you can add this line to
          <code class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
svn stream tcp nowait svnowner /usr/bin/svnserve svnserve -i
</pre></div><p>Make sure <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">svnowner</span>â</span> is a user that has
          appropriate permissions to access your repositories.  Now,
          when a client connection comes into your server on port
          3690, <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> will spawn an
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process to service it.  Of
          course, you may also want to add <code class="option">-r</code> to the
          configuration line as well, to restrict which repositories
          are exported.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="svnserve over a tunnel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.tunnel"></a>svnserve over a tunnel</h4></div></div></div><p>Another way to invoke <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> is in
          tunnel mode, using the <code class="option">-t</code> option.  This
          mode assumes that a remote-service program such as
          <span class="command"><strong>rsh</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> has
          successfully authenticated a user and is now invoking a
          private <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process <span class="emphasis"><em>as
          that user</em></span>.  (Note that you, the user, will
          rarely, if ever, have reason to invoke
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with the <code class="option">-t</code> at
          the command line; instead, the SSH daemon
          does so for you.)  The <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program
          behaves normally (communicating via
          <code class="filename">stdin</code> and <code class="filename">stdout</code>)
          and assumes that the traffic is being automatically
          redirected over some sort of tunnel back to the client.
          When <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> is invoked by a tunnel
          agent like this, be sure that the authenticated user has
          full read and write access to the repository database files.
          It's essentially the same as a local user accessing the
          repository via <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs.</p><p>This option is described in much more detail later in
          this chapter in <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth" title="Tunneling over SSH">the section called âTunneling over SSHâ</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="svnserve as a Windows service"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.winservice"></a>svnserve as a Windows service</h4></div></div></div><p>If your Windows system is a descendant of Windows NT
          (Windows 2000 or newer), you can
          run <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as a standard Windows
          service.  This is typically a much nicer experience than
          running it as a standalone daemon with
          the <code class="option">--daemon</code> (<code class="option">-d</code>) option.
          Using daemon mode requires launching a console, typing a
          command, and then leaving the console window running
          indefinitely.  A Windows service, however, runs in the
          background, can start at boot time automatically, and can be
          started and stopped using the same consistent administration
          interface as other Windows services.</p><p>You'll need to define the new service using the
          command-line tool <span class="command"><strong>SC.EXE</strong></span>.  Much like
          the <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span> configuration line, you must
          specify an exact invocation of <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          for Windows to run at startup time:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "C:\svn\bin\svnserve.exe --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</pre></div><p>This defines a new Windows service named
          <code class="literal">svn</code> which executes a particular
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve.exe</strong></span> command when started (in
          this case, rooted at <code class="filename">C:\repos</code>).  There
          are a number of caveats in the prior example,
          however.</p><p>First, notice that the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve.exe</strong></span>
          program must always be invoked with the
          <code class="option">--service</code> option.  Any other options to
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> must then be specified on the
          same line, but you cannot add conflicting options such as
          <code class="option">--daemon</code>
          (<code class="option">-d</code>), <code class="option">--tunnel</code>,
          or <code class="option">--inetd</code> (<code class="option">-i</code>).  Options
          such as <code class="option">-r</code>
          or <code class="option">--listen-port</code> are fine, though.  Second,
          be careful about spaces when invoking
          the <span class="command"><strong>SC.EXE</strong></span> command: the <code class="literal">key=
          value</code> patterns must have no spaces between
          <code class="literal">key=</code> and must have exactly one space
          before the <code class="literal">value</code>.  Lastly, be careful
          about spaces in your command line to be invoked.  If a
          directory name contains spaces (or other characters that
          need escaping), place the entire inner value of
          <code class="literal">binpath</code> in double quotes, by escaping
          them:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</pre></div><p>Also note that the word <code class="literal">binpath</code> is
          misleadingâits value is a <span class="emphasis"><em>command
          line</em></span>, not the path to an executable.  That's why
          you need to surround it with quotes if it contains
          embedded spaces.</p><p>Once the service is defined, it can be stopped, started,
          or queried using standard GUI tools (the Services
          administrative control panel), or at the command
          line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; net stop svn
C:\&gt; net start svn
</pre></div><p>The service can also be uninstalled (i.e., undefined) by

        only how to send a CRAM-MD5<sup>[<a id="idp39858496" href="#ftn.idp39858496" class="footnote">52</a>]</sup> authentication challenge.  In essence,
        the server sends a small amount of data to the client.  The
        client uses the MD5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of
        the data and password combined, and then sends the fingerprint
        as a response.  The server performs the same computation with
        the stored password to verify that the result is identical.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>At no point does the actual password travel over the
        network.</em></span></p><p>If your <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server was built with
        SASL support, it not only knows how to send CRAM-MD5 challenges,
        but also likely knows a whole host of other authentication
        mechanisms.  See <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl" title="Using svnserve with SASL">the section called âUsing <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with SASLâ</a> later in this
        chapter to learn how to configure SASL authentication and
        encryption.</p><p>It's also possible, of course, for the client to be
        externally authenticated via a tunnel agent, such as
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>.  In that case, the server simply
        examines the user it's running as, and uses this name as the
        authenticated username.  For more on this, see the later
        section, <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth" title="Tunneling over SSH">the section called âTunneling over SSHâ</a>.</p><p>As you've already guessed, a repository's
        <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file is the central
        mechanism for controlling authentication and authorization
        policies.  The file has the same format as other configuration
        files (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ</a>):
        section names are marked by square brackets
        (<code class="literal">[</code> and <code class="literal">]</code>), comments
        begin with hashes (<code class="literal">#</code>), and each section
        contains specific variables that can be set (<code class="literal">variable
        = value</code>).  Let's walk through these files and learn
        how to use them.</p><div class="sect3" title="Create a users file and realm"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth.users"></a>Create a users file and realm</h4></div></div></div><p>For now, the <code class="literal">[general]</code> section of
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> has all the variables you
          need.  Begin by changing the values of those variables:
          choose a name for a file that will contain your usernames
          and passwords and choose an authentication realm:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">realm</code> is a name that you define.
          It tells clients which sort of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">authentication
          namespace</span>â</span> they're connecting to; the Subversion
          client displays it in the authentication prompt and uses it
          as a key (along with the server's hostname and port) for
          caching credentials on disk (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="Caching credentials">the section called âCaching credentialsâ</a>).  The
          <code class="literal">password-db</code> variable points to a separate
          file that contains a list of usernames and passwords, using
          the same familiar format.  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[users]
harry = foopassword
sally = barpassword
</pre></div><p>The value of <code class="literal">password-db</code> can be an
          absolute or relative path to the users file.  For many
          admins, it's easy to keep the file right in the
          <code class="filename">conf/</code> area of the repository, alongside
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code>.  On the other hand, it's
          possible you may want to have two or more repositories share
          the same users file; in that case, the file should probably
          live in a more public place.  The repositories sharing the
          users file should also be configured to have the same realm,
          since the list of users essentially defines an
          authentication realm.  Wherever the file lives, be sure to
          set the file's read and write permissions appropriately.  If
          you know which user(s) <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> will run
          as, restrict read access to the users file as necessary.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Set access controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth.general"></a>Set access controls</h4></div></div></div><p>There are two more variables to set in the
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file: they determine what
          unauthenticated (anonymous) and authenticated users are
          allowed to do.  The variables <code class="literal">anon-access</code>
          and <code class="literal">auth-access</code> can be set to the value
          <code class="literal">none</code>, <code class="literal">read</code>, or
          <code class="literal">write</code>.  Setting the value to
          <code class="literal">none</code> prohibits both reading and writing;
          <code class="literal">read</code> allows read-only access to the
          repository, and <code class="literal">write</code> allows complete
          read/write access to the repository.  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users can only read the repository
anon-access = read

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</pre></div><p>The example settings are, in fact, the default values of
          the variables, should you forget to define them.  If you
          want to be even more conservative, you can block anonymous
          access completely:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users aren't allowed
anon-access = none

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</pre></div><p>The server process understands not only
          these <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">blanket</span>â</span> access controls to the
          repository, but also finer-grained access restrictions
          placed on specific files and directories within the
          repository.  To make use of this feature, you need to define
          a file containing more detailed rules, and then set
          the <code class="literal">authz-db</code> variable to point to
          it:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# Specific access rules for specific locations
authz-db = authzfile
</pre></div><p>We discuss the syntax of the <code class="filename">authzfile</code> file
          in detail later in this chapter, in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz" title="Path-Based Authorization">the section called âPath-Based Authorizationâ</a>.  Note
          that the <code class="literal">authz-db</code> variable isn't mutually
          exclusive with the <code class="literal">anon-access</code>
          and <code class="literal">auth-access</code> variables;  if all the
          variables are defined at once, <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
          of the rules must be satisfied before access is allowed.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Using svnserve with SASL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl"></a>Using <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> with SASL</h3></div></div></div><p>For many teams, the built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication is
        all they need from <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.  However, if
        your server (and your Subversion clients) were built with the
        Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) library,
        you have a number of authentication and encryption
        options available to you.</p><div class="sidebar" title="What Is SASL?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>What Is SASL?</strong></p></div></div></div><p>The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is
          open source software written by Carnegie Mellon University.
          It adds generic authentication and encryption capabilities
          to any network protocol, and as of Subversion 1.5 and later,
          both the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server
          and <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> client know how to make use of
          this library.  It may or may not be available to you: if
          you're building Subversion yourself, you'll need to have at
          least version 2.1 of SASL installed on your system, and
          you'll need to make sure that it's detected during
          Subversion's build process.  The Subversion command-line
          client will report the availability of Cyrus SASL when you
          run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong>; if you're using
          some other Subversion client, you might need to check with
          the package maintainer as to whether SASL support was
          compiled in.</p><p>SASL comes with a number of pluggable modules that
          represent different authentication systems: Kerberos
          (GSSAPI), NTLM, One-Time-Passwords (OTP), DIGEST-MD5, LDAP,
          Secure-Remote-Password (SRP), and others.  Certain
          mechanisms may or may not be available to you; be sure to
          check which modules are provided.</p><p>You can download Cyrus SASL (both code and
          documentation) from
          <a class="ulink" href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html" target="_top">http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html</a>.</p></div><p>Normally, when a subversion client connects to
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, the server sends a greeting that
        advertises a list of the capabilities it supports, and the
        client responds with a similar list of capabilities.  If the
        server is configured to require authentication, it then sends
        a challenge that lists the authentication mechanisms
        available; the client responds by choosing one of the
        mechanisms, and then authentication is carried out in some
        number of round-trip messages.  Even when SASL capabilities
        aren't present, the client and server inherently know how to
        use the CRAM-MD5 and ANONYMOUS mechanisms (see
        <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth" title="Built-in Authentication and Authorization">the section called âBuilt-in Authentication and Authorizationâ</a>).  If server
        and client were linked against SASL, a number of other
        authentication mechanisms may also be available.  However,
        you'll need to explicitly configure SASL on the server side to
        advertise them.</p><div class="sect3" title="Authenticating with SASL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.authn"></a>Authenticating with SASL</h4></div></div></div><p>To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server,
          you'll need to do two things.  First, create
          a <code class="literal">[sasl]</code> section in your
          repository's <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file with an
          initial key-value pair:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
</pre></div><p>Second, create a main SASL configuration file
          called <code class="filename">svn.conf</code> in a place where the
          SASL library can find itâtypically in the directory
          where SASL plug-ins are located.  You'll have to locate the
          plug-in directory on your particular system, such
          as <code class="filename">/usr/lib/sasl2/</code>
          or <code class="filename">/etc/sasl2/</code>.  (Note that this
          is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
          the <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file that lives
          within a repository!)</p><p>On a Windows server, you'll also have to edit the system
          registry (using a tool such as <span class="command"><strong>regedit</strong></span>)
          to tell SASL where to find things.  Create a registry key
          named <code class="literal">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie
          Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library]</code>, and place two
          keys inside it: a key called <code class="literal">SearchPath</code>
          (whose value is a path to the directory containing the SASL
          <code class="filename">sasl*.dll</code> plug-in libraries), and a key
          called
          <code class="literal">ConfFile</code> (whose value is a path to the
          parent directory containing
          the <code class="filename">svn.conf</code> file you created).</p><p>Because SASL provides so many different kinds of
          authentication mechanisms, it would be foolish (and far
          beyond the scope of this book) to try to describe every
          possible server-side configuration.  Instead, we recommend
          that you read the documentation supplied in the
          <code class="filename">doc/</code> subdirectory of the SASL source
          code.  It goes into great detail about every mechanism and
          how to configure the server appropriately for each.  For the
          purposes of this discussion, we'll just demonstrate a simple
          example of configuring the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism.  For
          example, if your <code class="filename">subversion.conf</code>
          (or <code class="filename">svn.conf</code>) file contains the
          following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
sasldb_path: /etc/my_sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5
</pre></div><p>you've told SASL to advertise the DIGEST-MD5
          mechanism to clients and to check user passwords against a
          private password database located
          at <code class="filename">/etc/my_sasldb</code>.  A system
          administrator can then use
          the <span class="command"><strong>saslpasswd2</strong></span> program to add or modify
          usernames and passwords in the database:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ saslpasswd2 -c -f /etc/my_sasldb -u realm username
</pre></div><p>A few words of warning: first, make sure the
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">realm</span>â</span> argument
          to <span class="command"><strong>saslpasswd2</strong></span> matches the same realm
          you've defined in your
          repository's <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file; if
          they don't match, authentication will fail.  Also, due to a
          shortcoming in SASL, the common realm must be a string with
          no space characters.  Finally, if you decide to go with the
          standard SASL password database, make sure
          the <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program has read access to
          the file (and possibly write access as well, if you're using
          a mechanism such as OTP).</p><p>This is just one simple way of configuring SASL.  Many
          other authentication mechanisms are available, and passwords
          can be stored in other places such as in LDAP or a SQL
          database.  Consult the full SASL documentation for
          details.</p><p>Remember that if you configure your server to only allow
          certain SASL authentication mechanisms, this forces all
          connecting clients to have SASL support as well.  Any
          Subversion client built without SASL support (which includes
          all pre-1.5 clients) will be unable to authenticate.  On the
          one hand, this sort of restriction may be exactly what you
          want (<span class="quote">â<span class="quote">My clients must all use Kerberos!</span>â</span>).
          However, if you still want non-SASL clients to be able to
          authenticate, be sure to advertise the CRAM-MD5 mechanism as
          an option.  All clients are able to use CRAM-MD5, whether
          they have SASL capabilities or not.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="SASL encryption"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.encryption"></a>SASL encryption</h4></div></div></div><p>SASL is also able to perform data encryption if a
          particular mechanism supports it.  The built-in CRAM-MD5
          mechanism doesn't support encryption, but DIGEST-MD5 does,
          and mechanisms such as SRP actually require use of the
          OpenSSL library.  To enable or disable different levels of
          encryption, you can set two values in your repository's
          <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256
</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">min-encryption</code> and
          <code class="literal">max-encryption</code> variables control the
          level of encryption demanded by the server.  To disable
          encryption completely, set both values to 0.  To enable
          simple checksumming of data (i.e., prevent tampering and
          guarantee data integrity without encryption), set both
          values to 1.  If you wish to allowâbut not
          requireâencryption, set the minimum value to 0, and
          the maximum value to some bit length.  To require encryption
          unconditionally, set both values to numbers greater than 1.
          In our previous example, we require clients to do at least
          128-bit encryption, but no more than 256-bit
          encryption.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Tunneling over SSH"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth"></a>Tunneling over SSH</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>'s built-in authentication (and
        SASL support) can be very handy, because it avoids the need to
        create real system accounts.  On the other hand, some
        administrators already have well-established SSH
        authentication frameworks in place.  In these situations, all
        of the project's users already have system accounts and the
        ability to <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">SSH into</span>â</span> the server machine.</p><p>It's easy to use SSH in conjunction with
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.  The client simply uses the
        <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URL scheme to connect:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ whoami
harry

$ svn list svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project
harryssh@host.example.com's password:  *****

foo
bar
baz
â¦
</pre></div><p>In this example, the Subversion client is invoking a local
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> process, connecting to
        <code class="literal">host.example.com</code>, authenticating as the
        user <code class="literal">harryssh</code> (according to SSH user
        configuration), then spawning a private
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process on the remote machine
        running as the user <code class="literal">harryssh</code>.  The
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> command is being invoked in tunnel
        mode (<code class="option">-t</code>), and its network protocol is being
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">tunneled</span>â</span> over the encrypted connection by
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>, the tunnel agent.
        If the client performs a commit, the authenticated username
        <code class="literal">harryssh</code> will be used as the author
        of the new revision.</p><p>The important thing to understand here is that the
        Subversion client is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> connecting to a
        running <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> daemon.  This method of
        access doesn't require a daemon, nor does it notice one if
        present.  It relies wholly on the ability of
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> to spawn a temporary
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> process, which then terminates
        when the network connection is closed.</p><p>When using <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs to access a
        repository, remember that it's the <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>
        program prompting for authentication, and
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> client
        program.  That means there's no automatic password-caching
        going on (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="Caching credentials">the section called âCaching credentialsâ</a>).
        The Subversion client often makes multiple connections to the
        repository, though users don't normally notice this due to the
        password caching feature.  When using
        <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs, however, users may be
        annoyed by <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> repeatedly asking for a
        password for every outbound connection.  The solution is to
        use a separate SSH password-caching tool such as
        <span class="command"><strong>ssh-agent</strong></span> on a Unix-like system, or
        <span class="command"><strong>pageant</strong></span> on Windows.</p><p>When running over a tunnel, authorization is primarily
        controlled by operating system permissions to the repository's
        database files; it's very much the same as if Harry were
        accessing the repository directly via a
        <code class="literal">file://</code> URL.  If multiple system users are
        going to be accessing the repository directly, you may want to
        place them into a common group, and you'll need to be careful
        about umasks (be sure to read <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.multimethod" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ</a> later in this
        chapter).  But even in the case of tunneling, you can still use the
        <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> file to block access, by
        simply setting <code class="literal">auth-access = read</code>
        or <code class="literal">auth-access = none</code>.<sup>[<a id="idp39976864" href="#ftn.idp39976864" class="footnote">53</a>]</sup></p><p>You'd think that the story of SSH tunneling would end
        here, but it doesn't.  Subversion allows you to create custom
        tunnel behaviors in your runtime <code class="filename">config</code>
        file (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called âRuntime Configuration Areaâ</a>).  For
        example, suppose you want to use RSH instead of
        SSH.<sup>[<a id="idp39980144" href="#ftn.idp39980144" class="footnote">54</a>]</sup>  In
        the <code class="literal">[tunnels]</code> section of your
        <code class="filename">config</code> file, simply define it like
        this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[tunnels]
rsh = rsh
</pre></div><p>And now, you can use this new tunnel definition by using a
        URL scheme that matches the name of your new variable:
        <code class="literal">svn+rsh://host/path</code>.  When using the new
        URL scheme, the Subversion client will actually be running the
        command <strong class="userinput"><code>rsh host svnserve -t</code></strong> behind the
        scenes.  If you include a username in the URL (e.g.,
        <code class="literal">svn+rsh://username@host/path</code>), the client
        will also include that in its command (<strong class="userinput"><code>rsh
        username@host svnserve -t</code></strong>).  But you can define new
        tunneling schemes to be much more clever than that:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[tunnels]
joessh = $JOESSH /opt/alternate/ssh -p 29934
</pre></div><p>This example demonstrates a couple of things.  First, it
        shows how to make the Subversion client launch a very specific
        tunneling binary (the one located at
        <code class="filename">/opt/alternate/ssh</code>) with specific
        options.  In this case, accessing an
        <code class="literal">svn+joessh://</code> URL would invoke the
        particular SSH binary with <code class="option">-p 29934</code> as
        argumentsâuseful if you want the tunnel program to
        connect to a nonstandard port.</p><p>Second, it shows how to define a custom environment
        variable that can override the name of the tunneling program.
        Setting the <code class="literal">SVN_SSH</code> environment variable is
        a convenient way to override the default SSH tunnel agent.
        But if you need to have several different overrides for
        different servers, each perhaps contacting a different port or
        passing a different set of options to SSH, you can use the
        mechanism demonstrated in this example.  Now if we were to set
        the <code class="literal">JOESSH</code> environment variable, its value
        would override the entire value of the tunnel
        variableâ<span class="command"><strong>$JOESSH</strong></span> would be executed
        instead of <strong class="userinput"><code>/opt/alternate/ssh -p
        29934</code></strong>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="SSH Configuration Tricks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks"></a>SSH Configuration Tricks</h3></div></div></div><p>It's possible to control not only the way in which the
        client invokes <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>, but also to control
        the behavior of <span class="command"><strong>sshd</strong></span> on your server
        machine.  In this section, we'll show how to control the
        exact <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> command executed
        by <span class="command"><strong>sshd</strong></span>, as well as how to have multiple
        users share a single system account.</p><div class="sect3" title="Initial setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.setup"></a>Initial setup</h4></div></div></div><p>To begin, locate the home directory of the account
          you'll be using to launch <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>.  Make
          sure the account has an SSH public/private keypair
          installed, and that the user can log in via public-key
          authentication.  Password authentication will not work,
          since all of the following SSH tricks revolve around using
          the SSH <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code> file.</p><p>If it doesn't already exist, create the
          <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code> file (on Unix,
          typically <code class="filename">~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>).
          Each line in this file describes a public key that is
          allowed to connect.  The lines are typically of the
          form:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euchâ¦ user@example.com
</pre></div><p>The first field describes the type of key, the second
          field is the base64-encoded key itself, and the third field
          is a comment.  However, it's a lesser known fact that the
          entire line can be preceded by a <code class="literal">command</code>
          field:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  command="program" ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euchâ¦ user@example.com
</pre></div><p>When the <code class="literal">command</code> field is set, the
          SSH daemon will run the named program instead of the
          typical tunnel-mode <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> invocation that the
          Subversion client asks for.  This opens the door to a number
          of server-side tricks.  In the following examples, we
          abbreviate the lines of the file as:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  command="program" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</pre></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Controlling the invoked command"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.fixedcmd"></a>Controlling the invoked command</h4></div></div></div><p>Because we can specify the executed server-side command,
          it's easy to name a specific <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>
          binary to run and to pass it extra arguments:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  command="/path/to/svnserve -t -r /virtual/root" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</pre></div><p>In this example, <code class="filename">/path/to/svnserve</code>
          might be a custom wrapper script
          around <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> which sets the umask (see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.multimethod" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called âSupporting Multiple Repository Access Methodsâ</a>).  It also
          shows how to anchor <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> in a virtual
          root directory, just as one often does when
          running <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as a daemon process.
          This might be done either to restrict access to parts of the
          system, or simply to relieve the user of having to type an
          absolute path in the <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code>
          URL.</p><p>It's also possible to have multiple users share a single
          account.  Instead of creating a separate system account for
          each user, generate a public/private key pair for each
          person.  Then place each public key into
          the <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code> file, one per
          line, and use the <code class="option">--tunnel-user</code>
          option:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry" TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=sally" TYPE2 KEY2 sally@example.com
</pre></div><p>This example allows both Harry and Sally to connect to
          the same account via public key authentication.  Each of
          them has a custom command that will be executed;
          the <code class="option">--tunnel-user</code> option
          tells <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> to assume that the named
          argument is the authenticated user.  Without
          <code class="option">--tunnel-user</code>, it would appear as though
          all commits were coming from the one shared system
          account.</p><p>A final word of caution: giving a user access to the
          server via public-key in a shared account might still allow
          other forms of SSH access, even if you've set
          the <code class="literal">command</code> value
          in <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code>.  For example, the
          user may still get shell access through SSH or be able to
          perform X11 or general port forwarding through your server.
          To give the user as little permission as possible, you may
          want to specify a number of restrictive options immediately
          after the <code class="literal">command</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forw
arding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
</pre></div><p>Note that this all must be on one lineâtruly on
          one lineâsince SSH <code class="filename">authorized_keys</code>
          files do not even allow the conventional backslash character
          (<code class="literal">\</code>) for line continuation.  The only
          reason we've shown it with a line break is to fit it on
          the physical page of a book.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="httpd, the Apache HTTP Server"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd"></a>httpd, the Apache HTTP Server</h2></div></div></div><p>The Apache HTTP Server is a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">heavy-duty</span>â</span>
      network server that Subversion can leverage.  Via a custom
      module, <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> makes Subversion repositories
      available to clients via the WebDAV/DeltaV<sup>[<a id="idp40037728" href="#ftn.idp40037728" class="footnote">55</a>]</sup>
      protocol, which is an extension to HTTP 1.1.  This protocol
      takes the ubiquitous HTTP protocol that is the core of the World
      Wide Web, and adds writingâspecifically, versioned
      writingâcapabilities.  The result is a standardized,
      robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
      Apache 2.0 software, supported by numerous operating systems and
      third-party products, and doesn't require network administrators
      to open up yet another custom port.<sup>[<a id="idp40038992" href="#ftn.idp40038992" class="footnote">56</a>]</sup> While an Apache-Subversion
      server has more features than <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, it's
      also a bit more difficult to set up.  With flexibility often
      comes more complexity.</p><p>Much of the following discussion includes references to
      Apache configuration directives.  While some examples are given
      of the use of these directives, describing them in full is
      outside the scope of this chapter.  The Apache team maintains
      excellent documentation, publicly available on their web site at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org</a>.  For example, a general
      reference for the configuration directives is located at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html</a>.</p><p>Also, as you make changes to your Apache setup, it is likely
      that somewhere along the way a mistake will be made.  If you are
      not already familiar with Apache's logging subsystem, you should
      become aware of it.  In your <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>
      file are directives that specify the on-disk locations of the
      access and error logs generated by Apache (the
      <code class="literal">CustomLog</code> and <code class="literal">ErrorLog</code>
      directives, respectively).
      Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> uses Apache's error
      logging interface as well.  You can always browse the contents
      of those files for information that might reveal the source of a
      problem that is not clearly noticeable otherwise.</p><div class="sect2" title="Prerequisites"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.prereqs"></a>Prerequisites</h3></div></div></div><p>To network your repository over HTTP, you basically need
        four components, available in two packages.  You'll need
        Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> 2.0 or newer, the
        <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> DAV module that comes with it,
        Subversion, and the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>
        filesystem provider module distributed with Subversion.
        Once you have all of those components, the process of
        networking your repository is as simple as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Getting httpd up and running with
            the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> module</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Installing the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> backend
            to <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span>, which uses Subversion's

            file to export (or expose) the repository</p></li></ul></div><p>You can accomplish the first two items either by
        compiling <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> and Subversion from
        source code or by installing prebuilt binary packages of
        them on your system.  For the most up-to-date information on
        how to compile Subversion for use with the Apache HTTP Server,
        as well as how to compile and configure Apache itself for
        this purpose, see the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file in
        the top level of the Subversion source code tree.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Basic Apache Configuration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.basic"></a>Basic Apache Configuration</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you have all the necessary components installed on
        your system, all that remains is the configuration of Apache
        via its <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file.  Instruct Apache
        to load the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module using the
        <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive.  This directive must
        precede any other Subversion-related configuration items.  If
        your Apache was installed using the default layout, your
        <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module should have been
        installed in the <code class="filename">modules</code> subdirectory of
        the Apache install location (often
        <code class="filename">/usr/local/apache2</code>).  The
        <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive has a simple syntax,
        mapping a named module to the location of a shared library on
        disk:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre></div><p>Apache interprets the <code class="literal">LoadModule</code>
        configuration item's library path as relative to its own
        server root.  If configured as previously shown, Apache will
        look for the Subversion DAV module shared library in its
        own <code class="filename">modules/</code> subdirectory.  Depending on
        how Subversion was installed on your system, you might need to
        specify a different path for this library altogether, perhaps
        even an absolute path such as in the following example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_svn_module     C:/Subversion/lib/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre></div><p>Note that if <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> was compiled as a
        shared object (instead of statically linked directly to the
        <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> binary), you'll need a similar
        <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> statement for it, too.  Be sure
        that it comes before the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre></div><p>At a later location in your configuration file, you now
        need to tell Apache where you keep your Subversion repository
        (or repositories).  The <code class="literal">Location</code> directive
        has an XML-like notation, starting with an opening tag and
        ending with a closing tag, with various other configuration
        directives in the middle.  The purpose of the
        <code class="literal">Location</code> directive is to instruct Apache to
        do something special when handling requests that are directed
        at a given URL or one of its children.  In the case of
        Subversion, you want Apache to simply hand off support for
        URLs that point at versioned resources to the DAV layer.  You
        can instruct Apache to delegate the handling of all URLs whose
        path portions (the part of the URL that follows the server's
        name and the optional port number) begin with
        <code class="filename">/repos/</code> to a DAV provider whose
        repository is located at
        <code class="filename">/var/svn/repository</code> using the
        following <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> syntax:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>If you plan to support multiple Subversion repositories
        that will reside in the same parent directory on your local
        disk, you can use an alternative
        directiveâ<code class="literal">SVNParentPath</code>âto
        indicate that common parent directory.  For example, if you
        know you will be creating multiple Subversion repositories in
        a directory <code class="filename">/var/svn</code> that would be
        accessed via URLs such as
        <code class="uri">http://my.server.com/svn/repos1</code>,
        <code class="uri">http://my.server.com/svn/repos2</code>, and so on, you
        could use the <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> configuration
        syntax in the following example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn

  # Automatically map any "/svn/foo" URL to repository /var/svn/foo
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>Using this syntax, Apache will delegate the
        handling of all URLs whose path portions begin with
        <code class="filename">/svn/</code> to the Subversion DAV provider,
        which will then assume that any items in the directory
        specified by the <code class="literal">SVNParentPath</code> directive
        are actually Subversion repositories.  This is a particularly
        convenient syntax in that, unlike the use of the
        <code class="literal">SVNPath</code> directive, you don't have to
        restart Apache to add or remove hosted repositories.</p><p>Be sure that when you define your new
        <code class="literal">Location</code>, it doesn't overlap with other
        exported locations.  For example, if your main
        <code class="literal">DocumentRoot</code> is exported to
        <code class="filename">/www</code>, do not export a Subversion
        repository in <code class="literal">&lt;Location /www/repos&gt;</code>.
        If a request comes in for the URI
        <code class="filename">/www/repos/foo.c</code>, Apache won't know
        whether to look for a file <code class="filename">repos/foo.c</code> in
        the <code class="literal">DocumentRoot</code>, or whether to delegate
        <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to return
        <code class="filename">foo.c</code> from the Subversion repository.
        The result is often an error from the server of the form
        <code class="literal">301 Moved Permanently</code>.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Server Names and the COPY Request"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Server Names and the COPY Request</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Subversion makes use of the <code class="literal">COPY</code>
          request type to perform server-side copies of files and
          directories.  As part of the sanity checking done by the
          Apache modules, the source of the copy is expected to be
          located on the same machine as the destination of the copy.
          To satisfy this requirement, you might need to
          tell <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> the name you use as the
          hostname of your server.  Generally, you can use
          the <code class="literal">ServerName</code> directive in
          <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> to accomplish this.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
ServerName svn.example.com
</pre></div><p>If you are using Apache's virtual hosting support via
          the <code class="literal">NameVirtualHost</code> directive, you may
          need to use the <code class="literal">ServerAlias</code> directive to
          specify additional names by which your server is known.
          Again, refer to the Apache documentation for full
          details.</p></div><p>At this stage, you should strongly consider the question
        of permissions.  If you've been running Apache for some time
        now as your regular web server, you probably already have a
        collection of contentâweb pages, scripts, and such.
        These items have already been configured with a set of
        permissions that allows them to work with Apache, or more
        appropriately, that allows Apache to work with those files.
        Apache, when used as a Subversion server, will also need the
        correct permissions to read and write to your Subversion
        repository.</p><p>You will need to determine a permission system setup that
        satisfies Subversion's requirements without messing up any
        previously existing web page or script installations.  This
        might mean changing the permissions on your Subversion
        repository to match those in use by other things that Apache
        serves for you, or it could mean using the
        <code class="literal">User</code> and <code class="literal">Group</code>
        directives in <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> to specify that
        Apache should run as the user and group that owns your
        Subversion repository.  There is no single correct way to set
        up your permissions, and each administrator will have
        different reasons for doing things a certain way.  Just be
        aware that permission-related problems are perhaps the most
        common oversight when configuring a Subversion repository for
        use with Apache.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Authentication Options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn"></a>Authentication Options</h3></div></div></div><p>At this point, if you configured
        <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> to contain something such as the
        following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>your repository is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">anonymously</span>â</span>
        accessible to the world.  Until you configure some
        authentication and authorization policies, the Subversion
        repositories that you make available via the
        <code class="literal">Location</code> directive will be generally
        accessible to everyone.  In other words:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Anyone can use a Subversion client to check out a
            working copy of a repository URL (or any of its
            subdirectories).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Anyone can interactively browse the repository's
            latest revision simply by pointing a web browser to
            the repository URL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Anyone can commit to the repository.</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, you might have already set up
        a <code class="filename">pre-commit</code> hook script to prevent
        commits (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks" title="Implementing Repository Hooks">the section called âImplementing Repository Hooksâ</a>).
        But as you read on, you'll see that it's also possible to use
        Apache's built-in methods to restrict access in specific
        ways.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Requiring authentication defends against invalid users

          provide the Basic authentication and related
          functionality:  <code class="literal">mod_auth_basic</code>,
          <code class="literal">mod_authn_file</code>, and
          <code class="literal">mod_authz_user</code>.  In many cases, these
          modules are compiled into <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> itself,
          but if not, you might need to explicitly load one or more of
          them using the <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule auth_basic_module   modules/mod_auth_basic.so
LoadModule authn_file_module   modules/mod_authn_file.so
LoadModule authz_user_module   moduels/mod_authz_user.so
</pre></div><p>After ensuring the Apache has access to the required
          functionality, you'll need to add some more directives
          inside the <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block to tell
          Apache what type of authentication you wish to use, and just
          how to to so:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>These directives work as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">AuthName</code> is an arbitrary name
              that you choose for the authentication domain.  Most

              prompting for username and password.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">AuthType</code> specifies the type of

              file.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">AuthUserFile</code> specifies the
              location of the password file to use.</p></li></ul></div><p>However, this <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block
          doesn't yet do anything useful.  It merely tells Apache that
          <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> authorization were required, it
          should challenge the Subversion client for a username and
          password.  (When authorization is required, Apache requires
          authentication as well.)  What's missing here, however, are
          directives that tell Apache <span class="emphasis"><em>which sorts</em></span>
          of client requests require authorization; currently, none do.
          The simplest thing is to specify that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
          requests require authorization by adding
          <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> to the block:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

          authentication which allows the server to verify a client's
          identity without sending the password over the network

          MD5 hash of the username, password, requested URI, and a
          <em class="firstterm">nonce</em> (number used once) provided by
          the server and changed each time authentication is required.
          The client sends its hash to the server, and the server then
          verifies that the hashes match.</p><p>Configuring Apache to use Digest authentication is
          straightforward.  You'll need to ensure that
          the <code class="literal">mod_auth_digest</code> module is available
          (instead of <code class="literal">mod_auth_basic</code>), and then

          adding <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directly inside

          <a class="ulink" href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn" target="_top">http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn</a> allows anyone
          in the world to perform read-only repository tasks (such as
          checking out working copies and browsing the repository),
          but restricts write operations to authenticated users.  The
          <code class="literal">Limit</code> and <code class="literal">LimitExcept</code>
          directives allow for this type of selective restriction.
          Like the <code class="literal">Location</code> directive, these blocks
          have starting and ending tags, and you would nest them
          inside your <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code>
          block.</p><p>The parameters present on the <code class="literal">Limit</code>
          and <code class="literal">LimitExcept</code> directives are HTTP
          request types that are affected by that block.  For example,
          to allow anonymous read-only operations, you would use the
          <code class="literal">LimitExcept</code> directive (passing the
          <code class="literal">GET</code>, <code class="literal">PROPFIND</code>,
          <code class="literal">OPTIONS</code>, and <code class="literal">REPORT</code>

</pre></div><p>These are only a few simple examples.  For more in-depth
          information about Apache access control and the
          <code class="literal">Require</code> directive, take a look at the
          <code class="literal">Security</code> section of the Apache
          documentation's tutorials collection at <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/misc/tutorials.html" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/misc/tutorials.html</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Per-directory access control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir"></a>Per-directory access control</h4></div></div></div><p>It's possible to set up finer-grained permissions using
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span>.  This Apache module grabs
          the various opaque URLs passing from client to server, asks
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to decode them, and then
          possibly vetoes requests based on access policies defined in
          a configuration file.</p><p>If you've built Subversion from source code,
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> is automatically built
          and installed alongside <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>.
          Many binary distributions install it automatically as well.
          To verify that it's installed correctly, make sure it comes
          right after <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>'s
          <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive in
          <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so
</pre></div><p>To activate this module, you need to configure your
          <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block to use the
          <code class="literal">AuthzSVNAccessFile</code> directive, which
          specifies a file containing the permissions policy for paths
          within your repositories.  (In a moment, we'll discuss the
          format of that file.)</p><p>Apache is flexible, so you have the option to configure
          your block in one of three general patterns.  To begin,
          choose one of these basic configuration patterns.  (The
          following examples are very simple; look at Apache's own
          documentation for much more detail on Apache authentication
          and authorization options.)</p><p>The most open approach is to allow access to everyone.
          This means Apache never sends authentication challenges, and
          all users are treated as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">anonymous</span>â</span>.  (See
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1" title="ExampleÂ 6.2.Â A sample configuration for anonymous access">ExampleÂ 6.2, âA sample configuration for anonymous accessâ</a>.)</p><div class="example"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>ExampleÂ 6.2.Â A sample configuration for anonymous access</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: None

  # Authorization: Path-based access control
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"></br><p>On the opposite end of the paranoia scale, you can
          configure Apache to authenticate all clients.
          This block unconditionally requires authentication via the
          <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directive, and defines
          a means to authenticate valid users.  (See
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2" title="ExampleÂ 6.3.Â A sample configuration for authenticated access">ExampleÂ 6.3, âA sample configuration for authenticated accessâ</a>.)</p><div class="example"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2"></a><p class="title"><strong>ExampleÂ 6.3.Â A sample configuration for authenticated access</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

  # Authorization: Path-based access control; authenticated users only
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"></br><p>A third very popular pattern is to allow a combination
          of authenticated and anonymous access.  For example, many
          administrators want to allow anonymous users to read certain
          repository directories, but restrict access to more
          sensitive areas to authenticated users.  In this setup, all
          users start out accessing the repository anonymously.  If
          your access control policy demands a real username at any
          point, Apache will demand authentication from the client.
          To do this, use both the <code class="literal">Satisfy Any</code>
          and <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directives.  (See
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3" title="ExampleÂ 6.4.Â A sample configuration for mixed authenticated/anonymous access">ExampleÂ 6.4, âA sample configuration for mixed

&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"></br><p>The next step is to create the authorization file
          containing access rules for particular paths within the
          repository.  We describe how later in this chapter, in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz" title="Path-Based Authorization">the section called âPath-Based Authorizationâ</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Disabling path-based checks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff"></a>Disabling path-based checks</h4></div></div></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module goes through a
          lot of work to make sure that data you've marked
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">unreadable</span>â</span> doesn't get accidentally leaked.
          This means it needs to closely monitor all of the paths
          and file-contents returned by commands such as <span class="command"><strong>svn
          checkout</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>.
          If these commands encounter a path that isn't
          readable according to some authorization policy, the
          path is typically omitted altogether.  In the case of
          history or rename tracingâfor example, running a command such
          as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn cat -r OLD foo.c</code></strong> on a file that
          was renamed long agoâthe rename tracking will simply
          halt if one of the object's former names is determined to be
          read-restricted.</p><p>All of this path checking can sometimes be quite
          expensive, especially in the case of <span class="command"><strong>svn
          log</strong></span>.  When retrieving a list of revisions, the
          server looks at every changed path in each revision and
          checks it for readability.  If an unreadable path is
          discovered, it's omitted from the list of the revision's
          changed paths (normally seen with
          the <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option),
          and the whole log message is suppressed.  Needless to say,
          this can be time-consuming on revisions that affect a large
          number of files.  This is the cost of security: even if you
          haven't configured a module such as
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> at all, the
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module is still asking Apache
          <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> to run authorization checks on
          every path.  The <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module has
          no idea what authorization modules have been installed, so
          all it can do is ask Apache to invoke whatever might be
          present.</p><p>On the other hand, there's also an escape hatch of
          sorts, which allows you to trade security features for
          speed.  If you're not enforcing any sort of per-directory
          authorization (i.e., not using
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> or similar module),
          you can disable all of this path checking.  In your
          <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file, use the
          <code class="literal">SVNPathAuthz</code> directive as shown in
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff.ex-1" title="ExampleÂ 6.5.Â Disabling path checks altogether">ExampleÂ 6.5, âDisabling path checks altogetherâ</a>.</p><div class="example"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff.ex-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>ExampleÂ 6.5.Â Disabling path checks altogether</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

            OpenSSL is unable to automatically trust the CA, or if some
            other problem occurs (such as an expired certificate or
            hostname mismatch), the Subversion command-line client will
            ask you whether you want to trust the server certificate

(R)eject, accept (t)emporarily or accept (p)ermanently?
</pre></div><p>This dialogue is essentially the same question you may
            have seen coming from your web browser (which is just
            another HTTP client like Subversion).  If you choose the
            <code class="literal">(p)</code>ermanent option, Subversion will
            cache the server certificate in your private runtime
            <code class="filename">auth/</code> area, just as your username and
            password are cached (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="Caching credentials">the section called âCaching credentialsâ</a>), and will
            automatically trust the certificate in the future.</p><p>Your runtime <code class="filename">servers</code> file also gives
            you the ability to make your Subversion client automatically
            trust specific CAs, either globally or on a per-host basis.
            Simply set the <code class="literal">ssl-authority-files</code>
            variable to a semicolon-separated list of PEM-encoded CA
            certificates:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[global]
ssl-authority-files = /path/to/CAcert1.pem;/path/to/CAcert2.pem
</pre></div><p>Many OpenSSL installations also have a predefined set
            of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">default</span>â</span> CAs that are nearly universally
            trusted.  To make the Subversion client automatically trust
            these standard authorities, set the
            <code class="literal">ssl-trust-default-ca</code> variable to
            <code class="literal">true</code>.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Client certificate challenge"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.ssl.client.clientcert"></a>Client certificate challenge</h5></div></div></div><p>If the client receives a challenge for a certificate,
            the server is asking the client to prove its identity.
            The client must send back a certificate signed by a CA
            that the server trusts, along with a <em class="firstterm">challenge
            response</em> which proves that the client owns the
            private key associated with the certificate.  The private
            key and certificate are usually stored in an encrypted
            format on disk, protected by a passphrase.  When Subversion
            receives this challenge, it will ask you for the path to the
            encrypted file and the passphrase that protects it:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn list https://host.example.com/repos/project

Authentication realm: https://host.example.com:443
Client certificate filename: /path/to/my/cert.p12
Passphrase for '/path/to/my/cert.p12':  ********
</pre></div><p>Notice that the client credentials are stored in a
            <code class="literal">.p12</code> file.  To use a client certificate
            with Subversion, it must be in PKCS#12 format, which is a
            portable standard.  Most web browsers are able to import
            and export certificates in that format.  Another option
            is to use the OpenSSL command-line tools to convert
            existing certificates into PKCS#12.</p><p>The runtime <code class="filename">servers</code> file also
            allows you to automate this challenge on a per-host basis.
            If you set the <code class="literal">ssl-client-cert-file</code>
            and <code class="literal">ssl-client-cert-password</code> variables,
            Subversion can automatically respond to a client
            certificate challenge without prompting you:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

          configuration for your Subversion repository is that your
          versioned files and directories are immediately available
          for viewing via a regular web browser.  Since Subversion
          uses URLs to identify versioned resources, those URLs used
          for HTTP-based repository access can be typed directly into
          a web browser.  Your browser will issue an
          HTTP <code class="literal">GET</code> request for that URL; based on
          whether that URL represents a versioned directory or
          file, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> will respond with a
          directory listing or with file contents.</p><div class="sect4" title="URL syntax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.syntax"></a>URL syntax</h5></div></div></div><p>If the URLs do not contain any information about which
            version of the resource you wish to
            see, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> will answer with the
            youngest version.  This functionality has the wonderful
            side effect that you can pass around Subversion URLs to
            your peers as references to documents, and those URLs will
            always point at the latest manifestation of that document.
            Of course, you can even use the URLs as hyperlinks from
            other web sites, too.</p><p>As of Subversion 1.6, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>
            supports a public URI syntax for examining older revisions
            of both files and directories.  The syntax uses the query
            string portion of the URL to specify either or both of a
            peg revision and operative revision, which Subversion will
            then use to determine which version of the file or
            directory to display to your web browser.  Add the query
            string name/value pair
            <code class="literal">p=<em class="replaceable"><code>PEGREV</code></em></code>,
            where <em class="replaceable"><code>PEGREV</code></em> is a revision
            number, to specify the peg revision you wish to apply to the
            request.  Use
            <code class="literal">r=<em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em></code>,
            where <em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em> is a revision number, to
            specify an operative revision.</p><p>For example, if you wish to see the latest version of a
            <code class="filename">README.txt</code> file located in your
            project's <code class="filename">/trunk</code>, point your web
            browser to that file's repository URL, which might look
            something like the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/README.txt
</pre></div><p>If you now wish to see some older version of that
            file, add an operative revision to the URL's query
            string:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/README.txt?r=1234
</pre></div><p>What if the thing you're trying to view no longer exists
            in the youngest revision of the repository?  That's where a
            peg revision is handy:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/deleted-thing.txt?p=321
</pre></div><p>And of course, you can combine peg revision and
            operative revision specifiers to fine-tune the exact item
            you wish to view:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

            be a bit tricky to wrap your head around.</p><p>As a reminder, this feature
            of <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> offers only a limited
            repository browsing experience.  You can see directory
            listings and file contents, but no revision properties
            (such as commit log messages) or file/directory
            properties.  For folks who require more extensive browsing
            of repositories and their history, there are several
            third-party software packages which offer this.  Some
            examples include ViewVC
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://viewvc.tigris.org" target="_top">http://viewvc.tigris.org</a>), Trac
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://trac.edgewall.org" target="_top">http://trac.edgewall.org</a>) and WebSVN
            (<a class="ulink" href="http://websvn.info" target="_top">http://websvn.info</a>).  These third-party
            tools don't affect <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>'s
            built-in <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">browseability</span>â</span>, and generally offer
            a much wider set of features, including the display of the
            aforementioned property sets, display of content
            differences between file revisions, and so on.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Proper MIME type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.mimetype"></a>Proper MIME type</h5></div></div></div><p>When browsing a Subversion repository, the web browser
            gets a clue about how to render a file's contents by
            looking at the <code class="literal">Content-Type:</code> header
            returned in Apache's response to the
            HTTP <code class="literal">GET</code> request.  The value of this
            header is some sort of MIME type.  By default, Apache will
            tell the web browsers that all repository files are of
            the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">default</span>â</span> MIME type,
            typically <code class="literal">text/plain</code>.  This can be
            frustrating, however, if a user wishes repository files to
            render as something more meaningfulâfor example,
            it might be nice to have a <code class="filename">foo.html</code> file
            in the repository actually render as HTML when
            browsing.</p><p>To make this happen, you need only to make sure that
            your files have the proper <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
            set.  We discuss this in more detail in
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called âFile Content Typeâ</a>,
            and you can even configure your client to automatically
            attach proper <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> properties
            to files entering the repository for the first time; see
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.auto" title="Automatic Property Setting">the section called âAutomatic Property Settingâ</a>.</p><p>Continuing our example, if one were to set
            the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property
            to <code class="literal">text/html</code> on
            file <code class="filename">foo.html</code>, Apache would properly
            tell your web browser to render the file as HTML.  One
            could also attach proper <code class="literal">image/*</code>
            MIME-type properties to image files and ultimately get an
            entire web site to be viewable directly from a repository!
            There's generally no problem with this, as long as the web
            site doesn't contain any dynamically generated
            content.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Customizing the look"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.xslt"></a>Customizing the look</h5></div></div></div><p>You generally will get more use out of URLs to
            versioned filesâafter all, that's where the
            interesting content tends to lie.  But you might have
            occasion to browse a Subversion directory listing, where
            you'll quickly note that the generated HTML used to
            display that listing is very basic, and certainly not
            intended to be aesthetically pleasing (or even
            interesting).  To enable customization of these directory
            displays, Subversion provides an XML index feature.  A
            single <code class="literal">SVNIndexXSLT</code> directive in your
            repository's <code class="literal">Location</code> block of
            <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> will
            instruct <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to generate XML
            output when displaying a directory listing, and to
            reference the XSLT stylesheet of your choice:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  SVNIndexXSLT "/svnindex.xsl"
  â¦
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>Using the <code class="literal">SVNIndexXSLT</code> directive
            and a creative XSLT stylesheet, you can make your
            directory listings match the color schemes and imagery
            used in other parts of your web site.  Or, if you'd
            prefer, you can use the sample stylesheets provided in the
            Subversion source distribution's
            <code class="filename">tools/xslt/</code> directory.
            Keep in mind that the path provided to the
            <code class="literal">SVNIndexXSLT</code> directory is actually a
            URL pathâbrowsers need to be able to read your
            stylesheets to make use of them!</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Listing repositories"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.reposlisting"></a>Listing repositories</h5></div></div></div><p>If you're serving a collection of repositories from a

            directive, then it's also possible to have Apache display
            all available repositories to a web browser.  Just
            activate the <code class="literal">SVNListParentPath</code>
            directive:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

            in <code class="filename">/var/svn</code>.  Obviously, this can be
            a security problem, so this feature is turned off by
            default.</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Apache logging"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.logging"></a>Apache logging</h4></div></div></div><p>Because Apache is an HTTP server at heart, it contains
          fantastically flexible logging features.  It's beyond the
          scope of this book to discuss all of the ways logging can be
          configured, but we should point out that even the most
          generic <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file will cause
          Apache to produce two logs:
          <code class="filename">error_log</code>
          and <code class="filename">access_log</code>.  These logs may appear
          in different places, but are typically created in the
          logging area of your Apache installation.  (On Unix, they
          often live
          in <code class="filename">/usr/local/apache2/logs/</code>.)</p><p>The <code class="filename">error_log</code> describes any internal
          errors that Apache runs into as it works.
          The <code class="filename">access_log</code> file records every
          incoming HTTP request received by Apache.  This makes it
          easy to see, for example, which IP addresses Subversion
          clients are coming from, how often particular clients use
          the server, which users are authenticating properly, and
          which requests succeed or fail.</p><p>Unfortunately, because HTTP is a stateless protocol,
          even the simplest Subversion client operation generates
          multiple network requests.  It's very difficult to look at
          the <code class="filename">access_log</code> and deduce what the
          client was doingâmost operations look like a series
          of cryptic <code class="literal">PROPPATCH</code>, <code class="literal">GET</code>,
          <code class="literal">PUT</code>, and <code class="literal">REPORT</code>
          requests.  To make things worse, many client operations send
          nearly identical series of requests, so it's even harder to
          tell them apart.</p><p><span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>, however, can come to
          your aid.  By activating an <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">operational
          logging</span>â</span> feature, you can
          ask <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to create a separate log
          file describing what sort of high-level operations your
          clients are performing.</p><p>To do this, you need to make use of
          Apache's <code class="literal">CustomLog</code> directive (which is
          explained in more detail in Apache's own documentation).
          Be sure to invoke this
          directive <span class="emphasis"><em>outside</em></span> your
          Subversion <code class="literal">Location</code> block:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  â¦
&lt;/Location&gt;

CustomLog logs/svn_logfile "%t %u %{SVN-ACTION}e" env=SVN-ACTION
</pre></div><p>In this example, we're asking Apache to create a special
          logfile, <code class="filename">svn_logfile</code>, in the standard
          Apache <code class="filename">logs</code> directory.
          The <code class="literal">%t</code> and <code class="literal">%u</code>
          variables are replaced by the time and username of the
          request, respectively.  The really important parts are the
          two instances of <code class="literal">SVN-ACTION</code>.
          When Apache sees that variable, it substitutes the value of
          the <code class="literal">SVN-ACTION</code> environment variable,
          which is automatically set by <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>
          whenever it detects a high-level client action.</p><p>So, instead of having to interpret a
          traditional <code class="filename">access_log</code> like
          this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

          populates the <code class="literal">SVN-REPOS</code>
          and <code class="literal">SVN-REPOS-NAME</code> variables, which carry
          the filesystem path to the repository and the basename
          thereof, respectively.  You might wish to include references
          to one or both of these variables in
          your <code class="literal">CustomLog</code> format string, too,

          Subversion server is that it can be set up for simple
          replication.  For example, suppose that your team is
          distributed across four offices around the globe.  The
          Subversion repository can exist only in one of those
          offices, which means the other three offices will not enjoy
          accessing itâthey're likely to experience
          significantly slower traffic and response times when
          updating and committing code.  A powerful solution is to set
          up a system consisting of one <em class="firstterm">master</em>
          Apache server and several <em class="firstterm">slave</em>
          Apache servers.  If you place a slave server in each office,
          users can check out a working copy from whichever slave
          is closest to them.  All read requests go to their local
          slave.  Write requests get automatically routed to the
          single master server.  When the commit completes, the master
          then automatically <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pushes</span>â</span> the new revision to
          each slave server using the <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>
          replication tool.</p><p>This configuration creates a huge perceptual speed
          increase for your users, because Subversion client traffic
          is typically 80â90% read requests.  And if those
          requests are coming from a <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span>
          server, it's a huge win.</p><p>In this section, we'll walk you through a standard setup
          of this single-master/multiple-slave system.  However, keep
          in mind that your servers must be running at least Apache
          2.2.0 (with <span class="command"><strong>mod_proxy</strong></span> loaded) and
          Subversion 1.5 (<span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Ours is just one example of how you might setup a
            Subversion write-through proxy configuration.  There are
            other approaches.  For example, rather than having the
            master server push changes out to every slave server, the
            slaves could periodically pull those changes from the
            master.  Or perhaps the master could push changes to a
            single slave, which then pushes the same change to the
            next slave, and so on down the line.  Administrators are
            encouraged to use this section for basic understanding
            of what happens in a Subversion WebDAV proxy deployment
            scenario, and then implement the specific approach that
            works best for their organization.</p></td></tr></table></div><div class="sect4" title="Configure the servers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.writethruproxy.configure"></a>Configure the servers</h5></div></div></div><p>First, configure your master server's
            <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file in the usual way.
            Make the repository available at a certain URI location,
            and configure authentication and authorization however
            you'd like.  After that's done, configure each of your
            <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">slave</span>â</span> servers in the exact same way, but
            add the special <code class="literal">SVNMasterURI</code> directive
            to the block:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  SVNMasterURI http://master.example.com/svn
  â¦
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>This new directive tells a slave server to redirect
            all write requests to the master.  (This is done
            automatically via Apache's <span class="command"><strong>mod_proxy</strong></span>
            module.)  Ordinary read requests, however, are still
            serviced by the slaves.  Be sure that your master and
            slave servers all have matching authentication and
            authorization configurations;  if they fall out of sync,
            it can lead to big headaches.</p><p>Next, we need to deal with the problem of infinite
            recursion.  With the current configuration, imagine what
            will happen when a Subversion client performs a commit to
            the master server.  After the commit completes, the server
            uses <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> to replicate the new
            revision to each slave.  But because
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> appears to be just another
            Subversion client performing a commit, the slave will
            immediately attempt to proxy the incoming write request
            back to the master!  Hilarity ensues.</p><p>The solution to this problem is to have the master
            push revisions to a different
            <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> on the slaves.  This
            location is configured to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> proxy
            write requests at all, but to accept normal commits from
            (and only from) the master's IP address:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn-proxy-sync&gt;

            your <code class="literal">Location</code> blocks on master and
            slaves, you need to configure the master to replicate to
            the slaves.  Our walkthough uses <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>,
            which is covered in more detail in
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.svnsync" title="Replication with svnsync">the section called âReplication with svnsyncâ</a>.</p><p>First, make sure that each slave repository has a

            standard procedure for being on the receiving end of
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>.) Then log into the master

            disk:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>The only thing we've left out here is what to do about
            user-level locks (of the <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>
            variety).  Locks are enforced by the master server during
            commit operations; but all the information about locks is
            distributed during read operations such as <span class="command"><strong>svn
            update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> by the
            slave server.  As such, a fully functioning proxy setup
            needs to perfectly replicate lock information from the
            master server to the slave servers.  Unfortunately, most
            of the mechanisms that one might employ to accomplish this
            replication fall short in one way or
            another<sup>[<a id="idp40427072" href="#ftn.idp40427072" class="footnote">60</a>]</sup>.  Many teams
            don't use Subversion's locking features at all, so this
            may be a nonissue for you.  Sadly, for those teams which
            do use locks, we have no recommendations on how to
            gracefully work around this shortcoming.</p></div><div class="sect4" title="Caveats"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.writethruproxy.caveats"></a>Caveats</h5></div></div></div><p>Your master/slave replication system should now be
            ready to use.  A couple of words of warning are in order,
            however.  Remember that this replication isn't entirely
            robust in the face of computer or network crashes.  For
            example, if one of the automated
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> commands fails to complete for
            some reason, the slaves will begin to fall behind.  For
            example, your remote users will see that they've committed
            revision 100, but then when they run <span class="command"><strong>svn
            update</strong></span>, their local server will tell them that
            revision 100 doesn't yet exist!  Of course, the problem
            will be automatically fixed the next time another commit
            happens and the subsequent <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> is
            successfulâthe sync will replicate all waiting
            revisions.  But still, you may want to set up some sort of
            out-of-band monitoring to notice synchronization failures
            and force <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> to run when things go
            wrong.</p><p>Another limitation of the write-through proxy
            deployment model involves version mismatchesâof the
            version of Subversion which is installed, that
            isâbetween the master and slave servers.  Each new
            release of Subversion may (and often does) add new
            features to the network protocol used between the clients
            and servers.  Since feature negotiation happens against
            the slave, it is the slave's protocol version and feature
            set which is used.  But write operations are passed
            through to the master server quite literally.  Therefore,
            there is always a risk that the slave server will answer a
            feature negotiation request from the client in way that is
            true for the slave, but untrue for the master if the
            master is running an older version of Subversion.  This
            could result in the client trying to use a new feature
            that the master doesn't understand, and failing.  There
            are a couple of known problems of this sort in Subversion
            1.7, which introduced a major revision of its HTTP
            protocol.  If you are deploying a Subversion 1.7 slave
            server in front of a pre-1.7 master, you'll want to
            configure your slave server's
            Subversion <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block with
            the <code class="literal">SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol Off</code>
            directive.</p><div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>For the best results possible, try to run the same

              of Apache as your server, you can certainly configure
              your repository's hook scripts to invoke
              <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> as we've shown here, thereby
              causing automatic replication from master to slaves.
              Unfortunately, at the time of this writing there is no way to
              make slave <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> servers
              automatically proxy write requests back to the master
              server.  This means your users would only be able to
              check out read-only working copies from the slave
              servers.  You'd have to configure your slave servers to
              disallow write access completely.  This might be useful
              for creating read-only <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mirrors</span>â</span> of popular
              open source projects, but it's not a transparent
              proxying system.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Other Apache features"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.other"></a>Other Apache features</h4></div></div></div><p>Several of the features already provided by Apache in
          its role as a robust web server can be leveraged for
          increased functionality or security in Subversion as well.
          The Subversion client is able to use SSL (the Secure Sockets
          Layer, discussed earlier).  If your Subversion client is
          built to support SSL, it can access your Apache server
          using <code class="literal">https://</code> and enjoy a high-quality
          encrypted network session.</p><p>Equally useful are other features of the Apache and
          Subversion relationship, such as the ability to specify a
          custom port (instead of the default HTTP port 80) or a
          virtual domain name by which the Subversion repository
          should be accessed, or the ability to access the repository
          through an HTTP proxy.</p><p>Finally, because <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> is
          speaking a subset of the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, it's
          possible to access the repository via third-party DAV
          clients.  Most modern operating systems (Win32, OS X, and
          Linux) have the built-in ability to mount a DAV server as a
          standard network <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">shared folder.</span>â</span> This is a
          complicated topic, but also wondrous when implemented.  For
          details, read <a class="xref" href="#svn.webdav" title="AppendixÂ C.Â WebDAV and Autoversioning">AppendixÂ C, <em>WebDAV and Autoversioning</em></a>.</p><p>Note that there are a number of other small tweaks one can
          make to <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> that are too obscure
          to mention in this chapter.  For a complete list of
          all <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> directives
          that <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> responds to, see
          <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.mod_dav_svn.conf.directives" title="Directives">the section called âDirectivesâ</a> in

      granting (or denying) permissions to users.  Typically this is
      done over the entire repository: a user can read the repository
      (or not), and she can write to the repository (or not).  It's
      also possible, however, to define finer-grained access rules.
      One set of users may have permission to write to a certain
      directory in the repository, but not others; another directory
      might not even be readable by all but a few special
      people.  As files are paths, too, it's even possible to restrict
      access on a per file basis.</p><p>Both servers use a common file format to describe these
      path-based access rules.  In the case of Apache, one needs to
      load the <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> module and then add
      the <code class="literal">AuthzSVNAccessFile</code> directive (within
      the <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file) pointing to your own
      access rules file.  (For a full explanation, see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir" title="Per-directory access control">the section called âPer-directory access controlâ</a>.)  If
      you're using <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, you need to make
      the <code class="literal">authz-db</code> variable
      (within <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code>) point to your access
      rules file.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Do You Really Need Path-Based Access Control?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Do You Really Need Path-Based Access Control?</strong></p></div></div></div><p>A lot of administrators setting up Subversion for the
        first time tend to jump into path-based access control without
        giving it a lot of thought.  The administrator usually knows
        which teams of people are working on which projects, so it's
        easy to jump in and grant certain teams access to certain
        directories and not others.  It seems like a natural thing,
        and it appeases the administrator's desire to maintain tight
        control of the repository.</p><p>Note, though, that there are often invisible (and
        visible!) costs associated with this feature.  In the visible
        category, the server needs to do a lot more work to ensure
        that the user has the right to read or write each specific
        path; in certain situations, there's very noticeable
        performance loss.  In the invisible category, consider the
        culture you're creating.  Most of the time, while certain
        users <span class="emphasis"><em>shouldn't</em></span> be committing changes to
        certain parts of the repository, that social contract doesn't
        need to be technologically enforced.  Teams can sometimes
        spontaneously collaborate with each other; someone may want to
        help someone else out by committing to an area she doesn't
        normally work on.  By preventing this sort of thing at the
        server level, you're setting up barriers to unexpected
        collaboration.  You're also creating a bunch of rules that
        need to be maintained as projects develop, new users are
        added, and so on.  It's a bunch of extra work to
        maintain.</p><p>Remember that this is a version control system!  Even if
        somebody accidentally commits a change to something she
        shouldn't, it's easy to undo the change.  And if a user
        commits to the wrong place with deliberate malice, it's a
        social problem anyway, and that the problem needs to be dealt
        with outside Subversion.</p><p>So, before you begin restricting users' access rights, ask
        yourself whether there's a real, honest need for this, or
        whether it's just something that <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">sounds good</span>â</span> to
        an administrator.  Decide whether it's worth sacrificing some
        server speed, and remember that there's very little risk
        involved; it's bad to become dependent on technology as a
        crutch for social problems.<sup>[<a id="idp40469456" href="#ftn.idp40469456" class="footnote">61</a>]</sup></p><p>As an example to ponder, consider that the Subversion
        project itself has always had a notion of who is allowed to
        commit where, but it's always been enforced socially.  This is
        a good model of community trust, especially for open source
        projects.  Of course, sometimes there <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
        truly legitimate needs for path-based access control; within
        corporations, for example, certain types of data really can be
        sensitive, and access needs to be genuinely restricted to
        small groups of people.</p></div><p>Once your server knows where to find your access file, it's
      time to define the rules.</p><p>The syntax of the file is the same familiar one used
      by <code class="filename">svnserve.conf</code> and the runtime
      configuration files.  Lines that start with a hash
      (<code class="literal">#</code>) are ignored.  In its simplest form, each
      section names a repository and path within it, as well as the
      authenticated usernames are the option names within each
      section.  The value of each option describes the user's level of
      access to the repository path: either
      <code class="literal">r</code> (read-only) or <code class="literal">rw</code>
      (read/write).  If the user is not mentioned at all, no access is
      allowed.</p><p>To be more specific: the value of the section names is
      either of the form <code class="literal">[repos-name:path]</code> or of the

        file.  It now does these comparisons case-sensitively.  If you

      <code class="literal">rw</code> permission to certain users on specific

      this still gives Jane read/write access.  Permissions for group

      file syntaxâusername aliases, authentication class tokens,
      and a new rule exclusion mechanismâall of which further
      simplify the maintenance of the access file.  We'll describe
      first the username aliases feature.</p><p>Some authentication systems expect and carry relatively
      short usernames of the sorts we've been describing
      hereâ<code class="literal">harry</code>,
      <code class="literal">sally</code>, <code class="literal">joe</code>, and so on.  But
      other authentication systemsâsuch as those which use LDAP
      stores or SSL client certificatesâmay carry much more
      complex usernames.  For example, Harry's username in an
      LDAP-protected system might be <code class="literal">CN=Harold
      Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com</code>.  With
      usernames like that, the access file can become quite bloated
      with long or obscure usernames that are easy to mistype.
      Fortunately, username aliases allow you to have to type the
      correct complex username only once, in a statement which assigns to
      it a more easily digestable alias.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[aliases]
harry = CN=Harold Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
sally = CN=Sally Swatterbug,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
joe = CN=Gerald I. Joseph,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
â¦
</pre></div><p>Once you've defined a set of aliases, you can refer to the
      users elsewhere in the access file via their aliases in all the
      same places you could have instead used their actual usernames.
      Simply prepend an ampersand to the alias to distinguish it from
      a regular username:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[groups]
calc-developers = &amp;harry, &amp;sally, &amp;joe
paint-developers = &amp;frank, &amp;sally, &amp;jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</pre></div><p>You might also choose to use aliases if your users'
      usernames change frequently.  Doing so allows you to need to
      update only the aliases table when these username changes occur,
      instead of doing global-search-and-replace operations on the
      whole access file.</p><p>Subversion also supports some <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">magic</span>â</span> tokens
      for helping you to make rule assignments based on the user's
      authentication class.  One such token is
      the <code class="literal">$authenticated</code> token.  Use this token
      where you would otherwise specify a username, alias, or group
      name in your authorization rules to declare the permissions
      granted to any user who has authenticated with any username at
      all.  Similarly employed is the <code class="literal">$anonymous</code>
      token, except that it matches everyone who has
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> authenticated with a username.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[calendar:/projects/calendar]
$anonymous = r
$authenticated = rw
</pre></div><p>Finally, another handy bit of access file syntax magic is
      the use of the tilde (<code class="literal">~</code>) character as an
      exclusion marker.  In your authorization rules, prefixing a
      username, alias, group name, or authentication class token with
      a tilde character will cause Subversion to apply the rule to
      users who do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> match the rule.  Though
      somewhat unnecessarily obfuscated, the following block is
      equivalent to the one in the previous example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[calendar:/projects/calendar]
~$authenticated = r
~$anonymous = rw
</pre></div><p>A less obvious example might be as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
[groups]
calc-developers = &amp;harry, &amp;sally, &amp;joe
calc-owners = &amp;hewlett, &amp;packard
calc = @calc-developers, @calc-owners

# Any calc participant has read-write access...
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc = rw

# ...but only allow the owners to make and modify release tags.
[calc:/projects/calc/tags]
~@calc-owners = r
</pre></div><p>All of the above examples use directories, because defining
      access rules on them is the most common case.  But is similarly
      able to restrict access on file paths, too.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

        made certain subdirectories of your repository unreadable to
        certain users, you need to be aware of a possible nonoptimal
        behavior with <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>.</p><p>When the client requests a checkout or update over HTTP,
        it makes a single server request and receives a single (often
        large) server response.  When the server receives the request,
        that is the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> opportunity Apache has
        to demand user authentication.  This has some odd side
        effects.  For example, if a certain subdirectory of the
        repository is readable only by user Sally, and user Harry
        checks out a parent directory, his client will respond to the
        initial authentication challenge as Harry.  As the server
        generates the large response, there's no way it can resend an
        authentication challenge when it reaches the special
        subdirectory; thus the subdirectory is skipped altogether,
        rather than asking the user to reauthenticate as Sally at the
        right moment.  In a similar way, if the root of the repository
        is anonymously world-readable, the entire checkout will be
        done without authenticationâagain, skipping the
        unreadable directory, rather than asking for authentication
        partway through.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="High-level Logging"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.serverconfig.operational-logging"></a>High-level Logging</h2></div></div></div><p>Both the Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span>

      Subversion server involves capacity planning and performance
      tuning.  Subversion doesn't tend to be particularly greedy in
      terms of server resources such as CPU cycles and memory, but any
      service can benefit from optimizations, especially when usage of
      the service skyrockets<sup>[<a id="idp40584768" href="#ftn.idp40584768" class="footnote">62</a>]</sup>.  In this section, we'll discuss
      some ways you can tweak your Subversion server configuration
      to offer even better performance and scalability.</p><div class="sect2" title="Data Caching"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.optimization.caching"></a>Data Caching</h3></div></div></div><p>Generally speaking, the most expensive part of a
        Subversion server's job is fetching data from the repository.
        Subversion 1.6 attempted to offset this cost by introducing
        some in-memory caching of certain classes of data read from
        the repository.  But Subversion 1.7 takes this a step further,
        not only caching the results of some of the more costly
        operations, but also by providing in each of the available
        servers the means by which fine-tune the size and some
        behaviors of the cache.</p><p>For <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, you can specify the size
        of the cache using the <code class="option">--memory-cache-size</code>
        (<code class="option">-M</code>) command-line option.  You can also
        dictate whether <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> should attempt to
        cache content fulltexts and deltas via the
        boolean <code class="option">--cache-fulltexts</code>
        and <code class="option">--cache-txdeltas</code> options,
        respectively.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svnserve -d -r /path/to/repositories \
           --memory-cache-size 1024 \
           --cache-txdeltas yes \
           --cache-fulltexts yes
â¦
$
</pre></div><p><span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> provides the same degree of
        cache configurability via <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>
        directives.
        The <code class="literal">SVNInMemoryCacheSize</code>,
        <code class="literal">SVNCacheFullTexts</code>,
        and <code class="literal">SVNCacheTextDeltas</code> directives may be
        used at the server configuration level to control Subversion's
        data cache characteristics:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;IfModule dav_svn_module&gt;

  SVNCacheFullTexts On
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre></div><p>So what settings should you use?  Certainly you need to
        consider what resources are available on your server.  To get
        any benefit out of the cache at all, you'll probably want to
        let the cache be at least large enough to hold all the files
        which are most commonly accessed in your repository (for
        example, your project's <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory

        greatly reduce the size of those network transmissions, but
        comes at the cost of server (and client) CPU cycles.
        Depending on your server's CPU capacity, the typical access
        patterns of the clients who use your servers, and the
        bandwidth of the networks between them, you might wish to fine
        tune just how hard your server will work to compress the data
        it sends across the wire.  To assist with this fine tuning
        process, Subversion 1.7 offers
        the <code class="option">--compression</code> (<code class="option">-c</code>)
        option to <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> and
        the <code class="literal">SVNCompressionLevel</code> directive
        for <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>.  Both accept a value which
        is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive), where 9 offers the
        best compression of wire data, and 0 disables compression
        altogether.</p><p>For example, on a local area network (LAN) with 1-Gigabit
        connections, it might not make sense to have the server
        compress its network transmissions (which also forces the
        clients to decompress them), as the network itself is so fast
        that users won't really benefit from the smaller overall
        network payload.  On the other hand, servers which are
        accessed primarily by clients with low-bandwidth connections
        would be doing those clients a favor by minimizing the overall
        size of its network communications.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"></a>Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods</h2></div></div></div><p>You've seen how a repository can be accessed in many
      different ways.  But is it possibleâor safeâfor your
      repository to be accessed by multiple methods simultaneously?
      The answer is yes, provided you use a bit of foresight.</p><p>At any given time, these processes may require read and
      write access to your repository:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Regular system users using a Subversion client (as
          themselves) to access the repository directly via
          <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Regular system users connecting to SSH-spawned private
          <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> processes (running as
          themselves), which access the repository</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> processâeither a
          daemon or one launched by
          <span class="command"><strong>inetd</strong></span>ârunning as a particular fixed
          user</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> process, running as a
          particular fixed user</p></li></ul></div><p>The most common problem administrators run into is
      repository ownership and permissions.  Does every process (or
      user) in the preceding list have the rights to read and write the
      repository's underlying data files?  Assuming you have a
      Unix-like operating system, a straightforward approach might be
      to place every potential repository user into a
      new <code class="literal">svn</code> group, and make the repository wholly
      owned by that group.  But even that's not enough, because a
      process may write to the database files using an unfriendly
      umaskâone that prevents access by other users.</p><p>So the next step beyond setting up a common group for
      repository users is to force every repository-accessing process
      to use a sane umask.  For users accessing the repository
      directly, you can make the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program into a
      wrapper script that first runs <strong class="userinput"><code>umask 002</code></strong> and
      then runs the real <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> client program.  You
      can write a similar wrapper script for the
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program, and add a <strong class="userinput"><code>umask
      002</code></strong> command to Apache's own startup script,
      <code class="filename">apachectl</code>.  For example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ cat /usr/bin/svn

#!/bin/sh

umask 002
/usr/bin/svn-real "$@"
</pre></div><p>Another common problem is often encountered on Unix-like
      systems.  If your repository is backed by Berkeley DB, for
      example, it occasionally creates new log files to journal its
      actions.  Even if the Berkeley DB repository is wholly owned by
      the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> group, these newly created log files
      won't necessarily be owned by that same group, which then
      creates more permissions problems for your users.  A good
      workaround is to set the group SUID bit on the
      repository's <code class="filename">db</code> directory.  This causes all
      newly created log files to have the same group owner as the
      parent directory.</p><p>Once you've jumped through these hoops, your repository
      should be accessible by all the necessary processes.  It may
      seem a bit messy and complicated, but the problems of having
      multiple users sharing write access to common files are classic
      ones that are not often elegantly solved.</p><p>Fortunately, most repository administrators will never
      <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to have such a complex configuration.
      Users who wish to access repositories that live on the same
      machine are not limited to using <code class="literal">file://</code>
      access URLsâthey can typically contact the Apache HTTP
      server or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> using
      <code class="literal">localhost</code> for the server name in their
      <code class="literal">http://</code> or <code class="literal">svn://</code> URL.
      And maintaining multiple server processes for your Subversion
      repositories is likely to be more of a headache than necessary.
      We recommend that you choose a single server that best meets your
      needs and stick with it!</p><div class="sidebar" title="The svn+ssh:// Server Checklist"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>The svn+ssh:// Server Checklist</strong></p></div></div></div><p>It can be quite tricky to get a bunch of users with

        that you (as an administrator) need to do on a Unix-like
        system, here's a quick checklist that resummarizes some of the
        topics discussed in this section:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>All of your SSH users need to be able to read and

            lives in <code class="literal">$PATH</code>) is actually a wrapper
            script that runs <strong class="userinput"><code>umask 002</code></strong> and
            executes the real <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>

    science, that offers myriad ways of getting stuff done.
    Throughout this book, you've read of the various Subversion
    command-line client subcommands and the options that modify their
    behavior.  In this chapter, we'll look into still more ways to
    customize the way Subversion works for youâsetting up the
    Subversion runtime configuration, using external helper
    applications, Subversion's interaction with the operating system's
    configured locale, and so on.</p><div class="sect1" title="Runtime Configuration Area"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.confarea"></a>Runtime Configuration Area</h2></div></div></div><p>Subversion provides many optional behaviors that the user can
      control.  Many of these options are of the kind
      that a user would wish to apply to all Subversion operations.
      So, rather than forcing users to remember command-line arguments
      for specifying these options and to use them for every
      operation they perform, Subversion uses configuration files,
      segregated into a Subversion configuration area.</p><p>The Subversion <em class="firstterm">configuration area</em> is
      a two-tiered hierarchy of option names and their values.
      Usually, this boils down to a special directory that contains
      <em class="firstterm">configuration files</em> (the first tier),
      which are just text files in standard INI format where
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">sections</span>â</span> provide the second tier.  You can
      easily edit these files using your favorite text editor (such as
      Emacs or vi), and they contain directives read by the client to
      determine which of several optional behaviors the user
      prefers.</p><div class="sect2" title="Configuration Area Layout"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.confarea.layout"></a>Configuration Area Layout</h3></div></div></div><p>The first time the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> command-line
        client is executed, it creates a per-user configuration area.
        On Unix-like systems, this area appears as a directory
        named <code class="filename">.subversion</code> in the user's home
        directory.  On Win32 systems, Subversion creates a folder
        named <code class="filename">Subversion</code>, typically inside
        the <code class="filename">Application Data</code> area of the user's
        profile directory (which, by the way, is usually a hidden
        directory).  However, on this platform, the exact location
        differs from system to system and is dictated by the Windows
        Registry.<sup>[<a id="idp41703568" href="#ftn.idp41703568" class="footnote">63</a>]</sup>
        We will refer to the per-user configuration area using its
        Unix name, <code class="filename">.subversion</code>.</p><p>In addition to the per-user configuration area, Subversion
        also recognizes the existence of a system-wide configuration
        area.  This gives system administrators the ability to
        establish defaults for all users on a given machine.  Note
        that the system-wide configuration area alone does not dictate
        mandatory policyâthe settings in the per-user
        configuration area override those in the system-wide one, and
        command-line arguments supplied to the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        program have the final word on behavior.  On Unix-like
        platforms, the system-wide configuration area is
        expected to be the <code class="filename">/etc/subversion</code>
        directory; on Windows machines, it looks for a
        <code class="filename">Subversion</code> directory inside the common
        <code class="filename">Application Data</code> location (again, as
        specified by the Windows Registry).  Unlike the per-user
        case, the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program does not attempt
        to create the system-wide configuration area.</p><p>The per-user configuration area currently contains three
        filesâtwo configuration files (<code class="filename">config</code> and
        <code class="filename">servers</code>), and a <code class="filename">README.txt</code> 
        file, which describes the INI format.  At the time of their
        creation, the files contain default values for each of the
        supported Subversion options, mostly commented out and grouped
        with textual descriptions about how the values for the key
        affect Subversion's behavior.  To change a certain behavior,
        you need only to load the appropriate configuration file into
        a text editor, and to modify the desired option's value.  If at
        any time you wish to have the default configuration settings
        restored, you can simply remove (or rename) your configuration
        directory and then run some innocuous <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        command, such as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn --version</code></strong>.  A new
        configuration directory with the default contents will be
        created.</p><p>Subversion also allows you to override individual
        configuration option values at the command line via
        the <code class="option">--config-option</code> option, which is
        especially useful if you need to make a (very) temporary
        change in behavior.  For more about this option's proper
        usage, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svn.sw" title="svn Options">the section called âsvn Optionsâ</a>.</p><p>The per-user configuration area also contains a cache of
        authentication data.  The <code class="filename">auth</code> directory
        holds a set of subdirectories that contain pieces of cached
        information used by Subversion's various supported
        authentication methods.  This directory is created in such a
        way that only the user herself has permission to read its
        contents.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Configuration and the Windows Registry"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry"></a>Configuration and the Windows Registry</h3></div></div></div><p>In addition to the usual INI-based configuration area,
        Subversion clients running on Windows platforms may also use
        the Windows Registry to hold the configuration data.  The
        option names and their values are the same as in the INI
        files.  The <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">file/section</span>â</span> hierarchy is
        preserved as well, though addressed in a slightly different
        fashionâin this schema, files and sections are just
        levels in the Registry key tree.</p><p>Subversion looks for system-wide configuration values
        under the
        <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</code>
        key.  For example, the <code class="literal">global-ignores</code> option,
        which is in the <code class="literal">miscellany</code> section of the
        <code class="filename">config</code> file, would be found at
        <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code>.
        Per-user configuration values should be stored under
        <code class="literal">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</code>.</p><p>Registry-based configuration options are parsed
        <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> their file-based counterparts, so
        they are overridden by values found in the configuration files.  In
        other words, Subversion looks for configuration information in
        the following locations on a Windows system; lower-numbered
        locations take precedence over higher-numbered locations:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Command-line options</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The per-user INI files</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The per-user Registry values</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The system-wide INI files</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The system-wide Registry values</p></li></ol></div><p>Also, the Windows Registry doesn't really support the
        notion of something being <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">commented out.</span>â</span>
        However, Subversion will ignore any option key whose name
        begins with a hash (<code class="literal">#</code>) character.  This
        allows you to effectively comment out a Subversion option
        without deleting the entire key from the Registry, obviously
        simplifying the process of restoring that option.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> command-line client never
        attempts to write to the Windows Registry and will not attempt
        to create a default configuration area there.  You can create
        the keys you need using the <span class="command"><strong>REGEDIT</strong></span>
        program.  Alternatively, you can create a
        <code class="filename">.reg</code> file (such as the one in <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry.ex-1" title="ExampleÂ 7.1.Â Sample registration entries (.reg) file">ExampleÂ 7.1, âSample registration entries (.reg) fileâ</a>), and
        then double-click on that file's icon in the Explorer shell,
        which will cause the data to be merged into your
        Registry.</p><div class="example"><a id="svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry.ex-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>ExampleÂ 7.1.Â Sample registration entries (.reg) file</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

                changes, it defers resolution of those conflicts to the
                user.  To assist in the resolution, Subversion keeps
                pristine copies of the various competing versions of
                the file in the working copy.  By default, those
                conflict files have names constructed by appending to
                the original filename a custom extension such as
                <code class="filename">.mine</code> or
                <code class="filename">.<em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em></code>
                (where <em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em> is a revision
                number).  A mild annoyance with this naming scheme is
                that on operating systems where a file's extension
                determines the default application used to open and
                edit that file, appending a custom extension prevents
                the file from being easily opened by its native
                application.  For example, if the file
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf</code> was conflicted,
                the conflict files might be named
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine</code> or
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231</code>.  While
                your system might be configured to use Adobe's Acrobat
                Reader to open files whose extensions are
                <code class="filename">.pdf</code>, there probably isn't an
                application configured on your system to open all
                files whose extensions are
                <code class="filename">.r4231</code>.</p><p>You can fix this annoyance by using this
                configuration option, though.  For files with one of
                the specified extensions, Subversion will append to
                the conflict file names the custom extension just as
                before, but then also reappend the file's original
                extension.  Using the previous example, and assuming
                that <code class="literal">pdf</code> is one of the extensions
                configured in this list thereof, the conflict files
                generated for <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf</code>
                would instead be named
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine.pdf</code> and
                <code class="filename">ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231.pdf</code>.
                Because each file ends in
                <code class="filename">.pdf</code>, the correct default
                application will be used to view them.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">use-commit-times</code></span></dt><dd><p>Normally your working copy files have timestamps

                convenient for people developing software, because
                build systems often look at timestamps as a way of
                deciding which files need to be recompiled.</p><p>In other situations, however, it's sometimes nice
                for the working copy files to have timestamps that
                reflect the last time they were changed in the
                repository.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn export</strong></span> command
                always places these <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">last-commit
                timestamps</span>â</span> on trees that it produces.  By
                setting this config variable to

                <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn

      programs behave in a region-specific way.  When a program
      formats numbers or dates in a way specific to your part of the
      world or prints messages (or accepts input) in your native
      language, the program is said to
      be <em class="firstterm">localized</em>.  This section describes
      steps Subversion has made toward localization.</p><div class="sect2" title="Understanding Locales"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.l10n.understanding"></a>Understanding Locales</h3></div></div></div><p>Most modern operating systems have a notion of the
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">current locale</span>â</span>âthat is, the region or
        country whose localization conventions are honored.  These
        conventionsâtypically chosen by some runtime
        configuration mechanism on the computerâaffect the way
        in which programs present data to the user, as well as the way
        in which they accept user input.</p><p>On most Unix-like systems, you can check the values of the
        locale-related runtime configuration options by running the
        <span class="command"><strong>locale</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ locale
LANG=
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_ALL="C"
$
</pre></div><p>The output is a list of locale-related environment
        variables and their current values.  In this example, the
        variables are all set to the default <code class="literal">C</code>
        locale, but users can set these variables to specific
        country/language code combinations.  For example, if one were
        to set the <code class="literal">LC_TIME</code> variable to
        <code class="literal">fr_CA</code>, programs would know to present
        time and date information formatted according to a
        French-speaking Canadian's expectations.  And if one were to
        set the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable to
        <code class="literal">zh_TW</code>, programs would know to present
        human-readable messages in Traditional Chinese.  Setting the
        <code class="literal">LC_ALL</code> variable has the effect of changing
        every locale variable to the same value.  The value of
        <code class="literal">LANG</code> is used as a default value for any
        locale variable that is unset.  To see the list of available
        locales on a Unix system, run the command <strong class="userinput"><code>locale
        -a</code></strong>.</p><p>On Windows, locale configuration is done via the
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Regional and Language Options</span>â</span> control panel
        item.  There you can view and select the values of individual
        settings from the available locales, and even customize (at a
        sickening level of detail) several of the display formatting
        conventions.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Subversion's Use of Locales"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.l10n.svnuse"></a>Subversion's Use of Locales</h3></div></div></div><p>The Subversion client, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>, honors the
        current locale configuration in two ways.  First, it notices
        the value of the <code class="literal">LC_MESSAGES</code> variable and
        attempts to print all messages in the specified language.  For
        example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
$ svn help cat
cat: Gibt den Inhalt der angegebenen Dateien oder URLs aus.
Aufruf: cat ZIEL[@REV]...
â¦
</pre></div><p>This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows
        systems.  Note, though, that while your operating system might
        have support for a certain locale, the Subversion client still
        may not be able to speak the particular language.  In order to
        produce localized messages, human volunteers must provide
        translations for each language.  The translations are written
        using the GNU gettext package, which results in translation
        modules that end with the <code class="filename">.mo</code> filename
        extension.  For example, the German translation file is named
        <code class="filename">de.mo</code>.  These translation files are
        installed somewhere on your system.  On Unix, they typically
        live in <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/</code>, while
        on Windows they're often found in the
        <code class="filename">share\locale\</code> folder in Subversion's
        installation area.  Once installed, a module is named after
        the program for which it provides translations.  For example, the
        <code class="filename">de.mo</code> file may ultimately end up
        installed as
        <code class="filename">/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</code>.
        By browsing the installed <code class="filename">.mo</code> files, you
        can see which languages the Subversion client is able to
        speak.</p><p>The second way in which the locale is honored involves how
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> interprets your input.  The repository
        stores all paths, filenames, and log messages in Unicode,
        encoded as UTF-8.  In that sense, the repository is
        <em class="firstterm">internationalized</em>âthat is, the
        repository is ready to accept input in any human language.
        This means, however, that the Subversion client is responsible
        for sending only UTF-8 filenames and log messages into the
        repository.  To do this, it must convert the data
        from the native locale into UTF-8.</p><p>For example, suppose you create a file named
        <code class="filename">caffÃ¨.txt</code>, and then when committing the
        file, you write the log message as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Adesso il caffÃ¨ Ã¨
        piÃ¹ forte.</span>â</span>  Both the filename and the log message contain
        non-ASCII characters, but because your locale is set to
        <code class="literal">it_IT</code>, the Subversion client knows to
        interpret them as Italian.  It uses an Italian character set
        to convert the data to UTF-8 before sending it off to the
        repository.</p><p>Note that while the repository demands UTF-8 filenames and
        log messages, it <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span> pay attention
        to file contents.  Subversion treats file contents as opaque
        strings of bytes, and neither client nor server makes an
        attempt to understand the character set or encoding of the
        contents.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Character Set Conversion Errors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Character Set Conversion Errors</strong></p></div></div></div><p>While using Subversion, you might get hit with an error
          related to character set conversions:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
svn: E000022: Can't convert string from native encoding to 'UTF-8':
â¦
svn: E000022: Can't convert string from 'UTF-8' to native encoding:
â¦
</pre></div><p>Errors such as this typically occur when the Subversion
          client has received a UTF-8 string from the repository, but
          not all of the characters in that string can be represented
          using the encoding of the current locale.  For example, if
          your locale is <code class="literal">en_US</code> but a collaborator
          has committed a Japanese filename, you're likely to see this
          error when you receive the file during an <span class="command"><strong>svn
          update</strong></span>.</p><p>The solution is either to set your locale to something
          that <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> represent the incoming UTF-8
          data, or to change the filename or log message in the
          repository.  (And don't forget to slap your collaborator's
          handâprojects should decide on common languages ahead of
          time so that all participants are using the same
          locale.)</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Using External Editors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.externaleditors"></a>Using External Editors</h2></div></div></div><p>The most obvious way to get data into Subversion is through
      the addition of files to version control, committing changes to
      those files, and so on.  But other pieces of
      information besides merely versioned file data live in your
      Subversion repository.  Some of these bits of
      informationâcommit log messages, lock comments, and some
      property valuesâtend to be textual in nature and are
      provided explicitly by users.  Most of this information can be
      provided to the Subversion command-line client using the
      <code class="option">--message</code> (<code class="option">-m</code>) and
      <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) options with the
      appropriate subcommands.</p><p>Each of these options has its pros and cons.  For example,
      when performing a commit, <code class="option">--file</code>
      (<code class="option">-F</code>) works well if you've already prepared a
      text file that holds your commit log message.  If you didn't,
      though, you can use <code class="option">--message</code>
      (<code class="option">-m</code>) to provide a log message on the command
      line.  Unfortunately, it can be tricky to compose anything more
      than a simple one-line message on the command line.  Users want
      more flexibilityâmultiline, free-form log message editing
      on demand.</p><p>Subversion supports this by allowing you to specify an
      external text editor that it will launch as necessary
      to give you a more powerful input mechanism for this textual
      metadata.  There are several ways to tell Subversion which
      editor you'd like use.  Subversion checks the following things,
      in the order specified, when it wants to launch such an
      editor:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">--editor-cmd</code> command-line option</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">SVN_EDITOR</code> environment variable</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">editor-cmd</code> runtime configuration option</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">VISUAL</code> environment variable</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">EDITOR</code> environment variable</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Possibly, a fallback value built into the Subversion
          libraries (not present in the official builds)</p></li></ol></div><p>The value of any of these options or variables is the
      beginning of a command line to be executed by the shell.
      Subversion appends to that command line a space and the pathname
      of a temporary file to be edited.  So, to be used with
      Subversion, the configured or specified editor needs to support
      an invocation in which its last command-line parameter is a file
      to be edited, and it should be able to save the file in place
      and return a zero exit code to indicate success.</p><p>As noted, external editors can be used to provide commit log
      messages to any of the committing subcommands (such as
      <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>import</strong></span>,
      <span class="command"><strong>svn mkdir</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>delete</strong></span> when
      provided a URL target, etc.), and Subversion will try to
      launch the editor automatically if you don't specify either of
      the <code class="option">--message</code> (<code class="option">-m</code>) or
      <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) options.  The
      <span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span> command is built almost entirely
      around the use of an external editor.  And beginning in version
      1.5, Subversion will also use the configured external text
      editor when the user asks it to launch an editor during
      interactive conflict resolution.  Oddly, there doesn't appear to
      be a way to use external editors to interactively provide lock
      comments.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Using External Differencing and Merge Tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.advanced.externaldifftools"></a>Using External Differencing and Merge Tools</h2></div></div></div><p>The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
      differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only
      contextual differencing capabilities were built around
      invocations of the GNU diffutils toolchain, specifically the
      <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>diff3</strong></span> utilities.
      To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these
      utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters,
      most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time
      later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library,
      and as a failover mechanism, the <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and
      <code class="option">--diff3-cmd</code> options were added to the
      Subversion command-line client so that users could more easily
      indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3
      utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.  If
      those options were used, Subversion would simply ignore the
      internal diff library, and fall back to running those external
      programs, lengthy argument lists and all.  And that's where
      things remain today.</p><p>It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such
      easy configuration mechanisms for specifying that Subversion
      should use the external GNU diff and diff3 utilities located at
      a particular place on the system could be applied toward the use
      of other differencing tools, too.  After all, Subversion didn't
      actually verify that the things it was being told to run were
      members of the GNU diffutils toolchain.  But the only
      configurable aspect of using those external tools is their
      location on the systemânot the option set, parameter
      order, and so on.  Subversion continues to throw all those GNU utility
      options at your external diff tool regardless of whether
      that program can understand those options.  And that's where
      things get unintuitive for most users.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way
        diff as part of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely
        by Subversion and is affected by, among other things, whether
        the files being operated on are human-readable as
        determined by their <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.
        This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
        Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the
        universe, it would never be invoked by Subversion as long as
        your versioned Word documents had a configured MIME type that
        denoted that they were not human-readable (such as
        <code class="literal">application/msword</code>).  For more about MIME
        type settings, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called âFile Content Typeâ</a></p></td></tr></table></div><p>Much later, Subversion 1.5 introduced interactive resolution
      of conflicts (described in
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="Resolve Any Conflicts">the section called âResolve Any Conflictsâ</a>).  One of the options
      that this feature provides to users is the ability to
      interactively launch a third-party merge tool.  If this action
      is taken, Subversion will check to see if the user has specified
      such a tool for use in this way.  Subversion will first check
      the <code class="literal">SVN_MERGE</code> environment variable for the
      name of an external merge tool.  If that variable is not set, it
      will look for the same information in the value of
      the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code> runtime configuration
      option.  Upon finding a configured external merge tool, it will
      invoke that tool.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></img></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While the general purposes of the three-way differencing
        and merge tools are roughly the same (finding a way to make
        separate-but-overlapping file changes live in harmony),
        Subversion exercises each of these options at different times
        and for different reasons.  The internal three-way
        differencing engine and its optional external replacement are
        used when interaction with the user
        is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> expected.  In fact, significant
        delay introduced by such a tool can actually result in the
        failure of some time-sensitive Subversion operations.  It's
        the external merge tool that is intended to be invoked
        interactively.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Now, while the interface between Subversion and an external
      merge tool is significantly less convoluted than that between
      Subversion and the diff and diff3 tools, the likelihood of
      finding such a tool whose calling conventions exactly match what
      Subversion expects is still quite low.  The key to using
      external differencing and merge tools with Subversion is to use
      wrapper scripts, which convert the input from Subversion into
      something that your specific differencing tool can understand,
      and then convert the output of your tool back into a format that
      Subversion expects.  The following sections cover the specifics
      of those expectations.</p><div class="sect2" title="External diff"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff"></a>External diff</h3></div></div></div><p>Subversion calls external diff programs with parameters
        suitable for the GNU diff utility, and expects only that the
        external program will return with a successful error code per
        the GNU diff definition thereof.  For most alternative diff
        programs, only the sixth and seventh argumentsâthe paths
        of the files that represent the left and right sides of the
        diff, respectivelyâare of interest.  Note that
        Subversion runs the diff program once per modified file
        covered by the Subversion operation, so if your program runs
        in an asynchronous fashion (or is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>â</span>),
        you might have several instances of it all running
        simultaneously.  Finally, Subversion expects that your program
        return an error code of 1 if your program detected
        differences, or 0 if it did notâany other error code is
        considered a fatal error.<sup>[<a id="idp42021696" href="#ftn.idp42021696" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup></p><p><a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff.ex-1" title="ExampleÂ 7.2.Â diffwrap.py">ExampleÂ 7.2, âdiffwrap.pyâ</a>

        perform non-interactive merges.  When configured to use an
        external three-way differencing program, it executes that
        program with parameters suitable for the GNU diff3 utility,
        expecting that the external program will return with a
        successful error code and that the full file contents that
        result from the completed merge operation are printed on the
        standard output stream (so that Subversion can redirect them
        into the appropriate version-controlled file).  For most
        alternative merge programs, only the ninth, tenth, and
        eleventh arguments, the paths of the files which represent
        the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mine</span>â</span>, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">older</span>â</span>,
        and <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">yours</span>â</span> inputs, respectively, are of
        interest.  Note that because Subversion depends on the output
        of your merge program, your wrapper script must not exit
        before that output has been delivered to Subversion.  When it
        finally does exit, it should return an error code of 0 if the
        merge was successful, or 1 if unresolved conflicts remain in
        the outputâany other error code is considered a fatal

    collection of libraries written in C.  Each library has a
    well-defined purpose and application programming interface (API),
    and that interface is available not only for Subversion itself to
    use, but for any software that wishes to embed or otherwise
    programmatically control Subversion.  Additionally, Subversion's
    API is available not only to other C programs, but also to
    programs written in higher-level languages such as Python, Perl,
    Java, and Ruby.</p><p>This chapter is for those who wish to interact with Subversion
    through its public API or its various language bindings.  If you
    wish to write robust wrapper scripts around Subversion
    functionality to simplify your own life, are trying to develop
    more complex integrations between Subversion and other pieces of
    software, or just have an interest in Subversion's various library
    modules and what they offer, this chapter is for you.  If,
    however, you don't foresee yourself participating with Subversion
    at such a level, feel free to skip this chapter with the

    affected.</p><div class="sect1" title="Layered Library Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.developer.layerlib"></a>Layered Library Design</h2></div></div></div><p>Each of Subversion's core libraries can be said to exist in
      one of three main layersâthe Repository layer, the
      Repository Access (RA) layer, or the Client layer (see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.intro.architecture.dia-1" title="FigureÂ 1.Â Subversion's architecture">FigureÂ 1, âSubversion's architectureâ</a> in the Preface).
      We will examine these layers shortly, but first, let's briefly
      summarize Subversion's various libraries.  For the sake of
      consistency, we will refer to the libraries by their
      extensionless Unix library names
      (<code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code>, <code class="filename">libsvn_wc</code>,
      <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code>, etc.).</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">libsvn_client</span></dt><dd><p>Primary interface for client

      appears only once in the previous list is a good sign.  The
      Subversion development team is serious about making sure that
      functionality lives in the right layer and libraries.  Perhaps
      the greatest advantage of the modular design is its lack of
      complexity from a developer's point of view.  As a developer,
      you can quickly formulate that kind of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">big
      picture</span>â</span> that allows you to pinpoint the location of
      certain pieces of functionality with relative ease.</p><p>Another benefit of modularity is the ability to replace a
      given module with a whole new library that implements the same
      API without affecting the rest of the code base.  In some sense,
      this happens within Subversion already.  The
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code>,
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_neon</code>,
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_serf</code>, and
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code> libraries each implement the
      same interface, all working as plug-ins to
      <code class="filename">libsvn_ra</code>.  And all four communicate with
      the Repository layerâ<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_local</code> connects to the
      repository directly; the other three do so over a network.  The
      <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code> and
      <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_fs</code> libraries are another pair of
      libraries that implement the same functionality in different
      waysâboth are plug-ins to the common
      <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> library.</p><p>The client itself also highlights the benefits of modularity
      in the Subversion design.  Subversion's
      <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> library is a one-stop shop
      for most of the functionality necessary for designing a working
      Subversion client (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.developer.layerlib.client" title="Client Layer">the section called âClient Layerâ</a>).  So while the
      Subversion distribution provides only the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
      command-line client program, several third-party
      programs provide various forms of graphical client UIs.
      These GUIs use the same APIs that the stock command-line client
      does.  This type of modularity has played a large role in the
      proliferation of available Subversion clients and IDE
      integrations and, by extension, to the tremendous adoption rate
      of Subversion itself.</p><div class="sect2" title="Repository Layer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.layerlib.repos"></a>Repository Layer</h3></div></div></div><p>When referring to Subversion's Repository layer, we're
        generally talking about two basic conceptsâthe versioned
        filesystem implementation (accessed via
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code>, and supported by its
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code> and
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_fs</code> plug-ins), and the repository
        logic that wraps it (as implemented in
        <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>).  These libraries provide
        the storage and reporting mechanisms for the various revisions
        of your version-controlled data.  This layer is connected to
        the Client layer via the Repository Access layer, and is, from
        the perspective of the Subversion user, the stuff at the
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">other end of the line.</span>â</span></p><p>The Subversion filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem
        that one would install in an operating system (such as the
        Linux ext2 or NTFS), but instead is a virtual filesystem.
        Rather than storing <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">files</span>â</span> and
        <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">directories</span>â</span> as real files and directories (the
        kind you can navigate through using your favorite shell
        program), it uses one of two available abstract storage
        backendsâeither a Berkeley DB database environment or a
        flat-file representation.  (To learn more about the two
        repository backends, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends" title="Choosing a Data Store">the section called âChoosing a Data Storeâ</a>.)  There has even
        been considerable interest by the development community in
        giving future releases of Subversion the ability to use other
        backend database systems, perhaps through a mechanism such as
        Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).  In fact, Google did
        something similar to this before launching the Google Code
        Project Hosting service:  they announced in mid-2006 that
        members of its open source team had written a new proprietary
        Subversion filesystem plug-in that used Google's ultra-scalable
        Bigtable database for its storage.</p><p>The filesystem API exported by
        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> contains the kinds of
        functionality you would expect from any other filesystem
        APIâyou can create and remove files and directories,
        copy and move them around, modify file contents, and so on.
        It also has features that are not quite as common, such as the
        ability to add, modify, and remove metadata
        (<span class="quote">â<span class="quote">properties</span>â</span>) on each file or directory.
        Furthermore, the Subversion filesystem is a versioning
        filesystem, which means that as you make changes to your
        directory tree, Subversion remembers what your tree looked
        like before those changes.  And before the previous changes.
        And the previous ones.  And so on, all the way back through
        versioning time to (and just beyond) the moment you first
        started adding things to the filesystem.</p><p>All the modifications you make to your tree are done
        within the context of a Subversion commit transaction.  The
        following is a simplified general routine for modifying your
        filesystem:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Begin a Subversion commit transaction.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Make your changes (adds, deletes, property
            modifications, etc.).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Commit your transaction.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once you have committed your transaction, your filesystem
        modifications are permanently stored as historical artifacts.
        Each of these cycles generates a single new revision of your
        tree, and each revision is forever accessible as an immutable
        snapshot of <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">the way things were.</span>â</span></p><div class="sidebar" title="The Transaction Distraction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>The Transaction Distraction</strong></p></div></div></div><p>The notion of a Subversion transaction can become easily
          confused with the transaction support provided by the
          underlying database itself, especially given the former's
          close proximity to the Berkeley DB database code in
          <code class="filename">libsvn_fs_base</code>.  Both types of
          transaction exist to provide atomicity and isolation.  In
          other words, transactions give you the ability to perform a
          set of actions in an all-or-nothing fashionâeither all
          the actions in the set complete with success, or they all
          get treated as though <span class="emphasis"><em>none</em></span> of them ever
          happenedâand in a way that does not interfere with
          other processes acting on the data.</p><p>Database transactions generally encompass small
          operations related specifically to the modification of data
          in the database itself (such as changing the contents of a
          table row).  Subversion transactions are larger in scope,
          encompassing higher-level operations such as making
          modifications to a set of files and directories that are
          intended to be stored as the next revision of the filesystem
          tree.  If that isn't confusing enough, consider the fact
          that Subversion uses a database transaction during the
          creation of a Subversion transaction (so that if the
          creation of a Subversion transaction fails, the database will
          look as though we had never attempted that creation in the first
          place)!</p><p>Fortunately for users of the filesystem API, the
          transaction support provided by the database system itself
          is hidden almost entirely from view (as should be expected
          from a properly modularized library scheme).  It is only
          when you start digging into the implementation of the
          filesystem itself that such things become visible (or
          interesting).</p></div><p>Most of the functionality the filesystem
        interface provides deals with actions that occur on individual
        filesystem paths.  That is, from outside the filesystem, the
        primary mechanism for describing and accessing the individual
        revisions of files and directories comes through the use of
        path strings such as <code class="filename">/foo/bar</code>, just as though
        you were addressing files and directories through your
        favorite shell program.  You add new files and directories by
        passing their paths-to-be to the right API functions.  You
        query for information about them by the same mechanism.</p><p>Unlike most filesystems, though, a path alone is not
        enough information to identify a file or directory in
        Subversion.  Think of a directory tree as a two-dimensional

        <em class="parameter"><code>root</code></em> argument.  This
        <code class="literal">svn_fs_root_t</code> argument describes
        either a revision or a Subversion transaction (which is simply
        a revision in the making) and provides that third dimension

        <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> API looks and feels like any
        other filesystem, except that it has this wonderful versioning
        capability.  It was designed to be usable by any program
        interested in a versioning filesystem.  Not coincidentally,
        Subversion itself is interested in that functionality.  But
        while the filesystem API should be sufficient for basic file
        and directory versioning support, Subversion wants
        moreâand that is where <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>
        comes in.</p><p>The Subversion repository library
        (<code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>) sits (logically speaking)
        atop the <code class="filename">libsvn_fs</code> API, providing
        additional functionality beyond that of the underlying
        versioned filesystem logic.  It does not completely wrap each
        and every filesystem functionâonly certain major steps
        in the general cycle of filesystem activity are wrapped by the
        repository interface.  Some of these include the creation and
        commit of Subversion transactions and the modification of
        revision properties.  These particular events are wrapped by
        the repository layer because they have hooks associated with
        them.  A repository hook system is not strictly related to
        implementing a versioning filesystem, so it lives in the
        repository wrapper library.</p><p>The hooks mechanism is but one of the reasons for the
        abstraction of a separate repository library from the rest of
        the filesystem code.  The <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>
        API provides several other important utilities to Subversion.
        These include the abilities to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Create, open, destroy, and perform recovery steps on a

        client libraries and the repository, this layer includes the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_ra</code> module loader library, the RA
        modules themselves (which currently includes

        so that the RA loader can, at runtime, determine which module
        to use for the task at hand.  You can determine which RA

        functionality necessary for sending and receiving versioned
        data to and from the repository.  And each of the available RA
        plug-ins is able to perform that task using a specific
        protocolâ<code class="filename">libsvn_ra_neon</code>
        and <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_serf</code> speak HTTP/WebDAV
        (optionally using SSL encryption) with an Apache HTTP Server
        that is running the <code class="filename">mod_dav_svn</code>
        Subversion server module; <code class="filename">libsvn_ra_svn</code>
        speaks a custom network protocol with the
        <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> program; and so on.</p><p>For those who wish to access a Subversion repository
        using still another protocol, that is precisely why the
        Repository Access layer is modularized!  Developers can simply
        write a new library that implements the RA interface on one
        side and communicates with the repository on the other.  Your
        new library can use existing network protocols or you can
        invent your own.  You could use interprocess communication
        (IPC) calls, orâlet's get crazy, shall we?âyou
        could even implement an email-based protocol.  Subversion
        supplies the APIs; you supply the creativity.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Client Layer"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.layerlib.client"></a>Client Layer</h3></div></div></div><p>On the client side, the Subversion working copy is where
        all the action takes place.  The bulk of functionality
        implemented by the client-side libraries exists for the sole
        purpose of managing working copiesâdirectories full of
        files and other subdirectories that serve as a sort of local,
        editable <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">reflection</span>â</span> of one or more repository
        locationsâand propagating changes to and from the
        Repository Access layer.</p><p>Subversion's working copy library,
        <code class="filename">libsvn_wc</code>, is directly responsible for
        managing the data in the working copies.  To accomplish this,
        the library stores administrative information about the
        working copy within a special subdirectory.  This
        subdirectory, named <code class="filename">.svn</code>, is present in
        each working copy and contains various other files
        and directories that record state and provide a private
        workspace for administrative action.  For those familiar with
        CVS, this <code class="filename">.svn</code> subdirectory is similar in
        purpose to the <code class="filename">CVS</code> administrative
        directories found in CVS working copies.</p><p>The Subversion client library,
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code>, has the broadest
        responsibility; its job is to mingle the functionality of the
        working copy library with that of the Repository Access layer,
        and then to provide the highest-level API to any application
        that wishes to perform general revision control actions.  For
        example, the function
        <code class="function">svn_client_checkout()</code> takes a URL as an
        argument.  It passes this URL to the RA layer and opens an
        authenticated session with a particular repository.  It then
        asks the repository for a certain tree, and sends this tree
        into the working copy library, which then writes a full
        working copy to disk (<code class="filename">.svn</code> directories
        and all).</p><p>The client library is designed to be used by any
        application.  While the Subversion source code includes a
        standard command-line client, it should be very easy to write
        any number of GUI clients on top of the client library.  New
        GUIs (or any new client, really) for Subversion need not be
        clunky wrappers around the included command-line
        clientâthey have full access via the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> API to the same functionality,
        data, and callback mechanisms that the command-line client
        uses.  In fact, the Subversion source code tree contains a
        small C program (which you can find at
        <code class="filename">tools/examples/minimal_client.c</code>) that
        exemplifies how to wield the Subversion API to create a simple
        client program.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Binding DirectlyâA Word About Correctness"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Binding DirectlyâA Word About Correctness</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Why should your GUI program bind directly with a
          <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> instead of acting as a
          wrapper around a command-line program?  Besides simply being
          more efficient, it can be more correct as well.  A
          command-line program (such as the one supplied with
          Subversion) that binds to the client library needs to
          effectively translate feedback and requested data bits from
          C types to some form of human-readable output.  This type of
          translation can be lossy.  That is, the program may not
          display all of the information harvested from the API or may
          combine bits of information for compact
          representation.</p><p>If you wrap such a command-line program with yet another
          program, the second program has access only to
          already interpreted (and as we mentioned, likely incomplete)
          information, which it must <span class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span>
          translate into <span class="emphasis"><em>its</em></span> representation
          format.  With each layer of wrapping, the integrity of the
          original data is potentially tainted more and more, much
          like the result of making a copy of a copy (of a copyâ¦)
          of a favorite audio or video cassette.</p><p>But the most compelling argument for binding directly to
          the APIs instead of wrapping other programs is that the
          Subversion project makes compatibility promises regarding
          its APIs.  Across minor versions of those APIs (such as
          between 1.3 and 1.4), no function's prototype will change.
          In other words, you aren't forced to update your program's
          source code simply because you've upgraded to a new version
          of Subversion.  Certain functions might be deprecated, but
          they still work, and this gives you a buffer of time to
          eventually embrace the newer APIs.  These kinds of
          compatibility promises do not exist for Subversion
          command-line program output, which is subject to change from
          release to release.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Using the APIs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.developer.usingapi"></a>Using the APIs</h2></div></div></div><p>Developing applications against the Subversion library APIs
      is fairly straightforward.  Subversion is primarily a set of C
      libraries, with header (<code class="filename">.h</code>) files that live
      in the <code class="filename">subversion/include</code> directory of the
      source tree.  These headers are copied into your system
      locations (e.g., <code class="filename">/usr/local/include</code>)
      when you build and install Subversion itself from source.  These
      headers represent the entirety of the functions and types meant
      to be accessible by users of the Subversion libraries.  The
      Subversion developer community is meticulous about ensuring that
      the public API is well documentedârefer directly to the
      header files for that documentation.</p><p>When examining the public header files, the first thing you
      might notice is that Subversion's datatypes and functions are
      namespace-protected.  That is, every public Subversion symbol
      name begins with <code class="literal">svn_</code>, followed by a short
      code for the library in which the symbol is defined (such as
      <code class="literal">wc</code>, <code class="literal">client</code>,
      <code class="literal">fs</code>, etc.), followed by a single underscore
      (<code class="literal">_</code>), and then the rest of the symbol name.
      Semipublic functions (used among source files of a given
      library but not by code outside that library, and found inside
      the library directories themselves) differ from this naming
      scheme in that instead of a single underscore after the library
      code, they use a double underscore
      (<code class="literal">_â_</code>).  Functions that are private to
      a given source file have no special prefixing and are declared
      <code class="literal">static</code>.  Of course, a compiler isn't
      interested in these naming conventions, but they help to clarify
      the scope of a given function or datatype.</p><p>Another good source of information about programming against
      the Subversion APIs is the project's own hacking guidelines,
      which you can find at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</a>.  This document contains useful information, which, while
      aimed at developers and would-be developers of Subversion
      itself, is equally applicable to folks developing against
      Subversion as a set of third-party
      libraries.<sup>[<a id="idp42602352" href="#ftn.idp42602352" class="footnote">67</a>]</sup></p><div class="sect2" title="The Apache Portable Runtime Library"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.usingapi.apr"></a>The Apache Portable Runtime Library</h3></div></div></div><p>Along with Subversion's own datatypes, you will see many
        references to datatypes that begin with
        <code class="literal">apr_</code>âsymbols from the Apache Portable
        Runtime (APR) library.  APR is Apache's portability library,
        originally carved out of its server code as an attempt to
        separate the OS-specific bits from the OS-independent portions
        of the code.  The result was a library that provides a generic
        API for performing operations that differ mildlyâor
        wildlyâfrom OS to OS.  While the Apache HTTP Server was
        obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion
        developers immediately recognized the value of using APR as
        well.  This means that there is practically no OS-specific
        code in Subversion itself.  Also, it means that the Subversion
        client compiles and runs anywhere that the Apache HTTP Server
        does.  Currently, this list includes all flavors of Unix,
        Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X.</p><p>In addition to providing consistent implementations of
        system calls that differ across operating
        systems,<sup>[<a id="idp42605888" href="#ftn.idp42605888" class="footnote">68</a>]</sup> APR gives
        Subversion immediate access to many custom datatypes, such as
        dynamic arrays and hash tables.  Subversion uses these types
        extensively.  But perhaps the most pervasive APR datatype,
        found in nearly every Subversion API prototype, is the
        <code class="literal">apr_pool_t</code>âthe APR memory pool.
        Subversion uses pools internally for all its memory allocation
        needs (unless an external library requires a different memory
        management mechanism for data passed through its
        API),<sup>[<a id="idp42608832" href="#ftn.idp42608832" class="footnote">69</a>]</sup> and while a person coding against
        the Subversion APIs is not required to do the same,
        she <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> required to provide pools to the
        API functions that need them.  This means that users of the
        Subversion API must also link against APR, must
        call <code class="function">apr_initialize()</code> to initialize the
        APR subsystem, and then must create and manage pools for use
        with Subversion API calls, typically by
        using <code class="function">svn_pool_create()</code>,
        <code class="function">svn_pool_clear()</code>, and
        <code class="function">svn_pool_destroy()</code>.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Programming with Memory Pools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Programming with Memory Pools</strong></p></div></div></div><p>Almost every developer who has used the C programming
          language has at some point sighed at the daunting task of
          managing memory usage.  Allocating enough memory to use,
          keeping track of those allocations, freeing the memory when
          you no longer need itâthese tasks can be quite
          complex.  And of course, failure to do those things properly
          can result in a program that crashes itself, or worse,
          crashes the computer.</p><p>Higher-level languages, on the other hand, either take
          the job of memory management away from you completely or
          make it something you toy with only when doing extremely
          tight program optimization.  Languages such as Java and
          Python use <em class="firstterm">garbage collection</em>,
          allocating memory for objects when needed, and automatically
          freeing that memory when the object is no longer in
          use.</p><p>APR provides a middle-ground approach called
          <em class="firstterm">pool-based memory management</em>.  It
          allows the developer to control memory usage at a lower
          resolutionâper chunk (or <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pool</span>â</span>) of
          memory, instead of per allocated object.  Rather than using
          <code class="function">malloc()</code> and friends to allocate enough
          memory for a given object, you ask APR to allocate the
          memory from a memory pool.  When you're finished using the
          objects you've created in the pool, you destroy the entire
          pool, effectively de-allocating the memory consumed by
          <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the objects you allocated from it.
          Thus, rather than keeping track of individual objects that
          need to be de-allocated, your program simply considers the
          general lifetimes of those objects and allocates the objects
          in a pool whose lifetime (the time between the pool's
          creation and its deletion) matches the object's
          needs.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Functions and Batons"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.usingapi.funcsbatons"></a>Functions and Batons</h3></div></div></div><p>To facilitate <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">streamy</span>â</span> (asynchronous) behavior
        and provide consumers of the Subversion C API with hooks for
        handling information in customizable ways, many functions in
        the API accept pairs of parameters: a pointer to a callback
        function, and a pointer to a blob of memory called
        a <em class="firstterm">baton</em> that carries context
        information for that callback function.  Batons are typically
        C structures with additional information that the callback
        function needs but which is not given directly to the callback
        function by the driving API function.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="URL and Path Requirements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.usingapi.urlpath"></a>URL and Path Requirements</h3></div></div></div><p>With remote version control operation as the whole point
        of Subversion's existence, it makes sense that some attention
        has been paid to internationalization (i18n) support.  After
        all, while <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">remote</span>â</span> might mean <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">across the
        office,</span>â</span> it could just as well mean <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">across the
        globe.</span>â</span> To facilitate this, all of Subversion's public
        interfaces that accept path arguments expect those paths to be
        canonicalizedâwhich is most easily accomplished by
        passing them through <code class="function">svn_dirent_canonicalize()</code>
        or <code class="function">svn_uri_canonicalize()</code> (depending on
        whether you are canonicalizing a local system path or a URL,
        respectively)âand encoded in UTF-8.  This means, for
        example, that any new client binary that drives the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> interface needs to first
        convert paths from the locale-specific encoding to UTF-8
        before passing those paths to the Subversion libraries, and
        then reconvert any resultant output paths from Subversion
        back into the locale's encoding before using those paths for
        non-Subversion purposes.  Fortunately, Subversion provides a
        suite of functions (see
        <code class="filename">subversion/include/svn_utf.h</code>) that 
        any program can use to do these conversions.</p><p>Also, Subversion APIs require all URL parameters to be
        properly URI-encoded.  So, instead of passing
        <code class="uri">file:///home/username/MyÂ File.txt</code> as the URL of a
        file named <code class="filename">MyÂ File.txt</code>, you need to pass
        <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My%20File.txt</code>.  Again,
        Subversion supplies helper functions that your application can
        useâ<code class="function">svn_path_uri_encode()</code> and
        <code class="function">svn_path_uri_decode()</code>, for URI encoding
        and decoding, respectively.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using Languages Other Than C and C++"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs"></a>Using Languages Other Than C and C++</h3></div></div></div><p>If you are interested in using the Subversion libraries in
        conjunction with something other than a C programâsay, a
        Python or Perl scriptâSubversion has some support for this
        via the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG).  The
        SWIG bindings for Subversion are located in
        <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/swig</code>.  They are still
        maturing, but they are usable.  These bindings allow you
        to call Subversion API functions indirectly, using wrappers that
        translate the datatypes native to your scripting language into
        the datatypes needed by Subversion's C libraries.</p><p>Significant efforts have been made toward creating
        functional SWIG-generated bindings for Python, Perl, and Ruby.
        To some extent, the work done preparing the SWIG interface
        files for these languages is reusable in efforts to generate
        bindings for other languages supported by SWIG (which include
        versions of C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, OCaml, PHP, and Tcl,
        among others).  However, some extra programming is required to
        compensate for complex APIs that SWIG needs some help
        translating between languages.  For more information on SWIG
        itself, see the project's web site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.swig.org/" target="_top">http://www.swig.org/</a>.</p><p>Subversion also has language bindings for Java.  The
        javahl bindings (located in
        <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/java</code> in the
        Subversion source tree) aren't SWIG-based, but are instead a
        mixture of Java and hand-coded JNI.  Javahl covers most
        Subversion client-side APIs and is specifically targeted at
        implementors of Java-based Subversion clients and IDE
        integrations.</p><p>Subversion's language bindings tend to lack the level of
        developer attention given to the core Subversion modules, but
        can generally be trusted as production-ready.  A number of
        scripts and applications, alternative Subversion GUI clients,
        and other third-party tools are successfully using
        Subversion's language bindings today to accomplish their
        Subversion integrations.</p><p>It's worth noting here that there are other options for
        interfacing with Subversion using other languages:  alternative
        bindings for Subversion that aren't provided by the
        Subversion development community at all.  There
        are a couple of popular ones we feel are especially
        noteworthy.  First, Barry Scott's PySVN bindings (<a class="ulink" href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://pysvn.tigris.org/</a>) are a popular option for
        binding with Python.  PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic
        interface than the more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's
        own Python bindings.  And if you're looking for a pure Java
        implementation of Subversion, check out SVNKit (<a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>), which is Subversion rewritten
        from the ground up in Java.</p><div class="sidebar" title="SVNKit Versus javahl"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>SVNKit Versus javahl</strong></p></div></div></div><p>In 2005, a small company called TMate announced the
          1.0.0 release of JavaSVNâa pure Java implementation of
          Subversion.  Since then, the project has been renamed to
          SVNKit (available at <a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>)
          and has seen great success as a provider of Subversion
          functionality to various Subversion clients, IDE
          integrations, and other third-party tools.</p><p>The SVNKit library is interesting in that, unlike the
          javahl library, it is not merely a wrapper around the
          official Subversion core libraries.  In fact, it shares no
          code with Subversion at all.  But while it is easy to
          confuse SVNKit with javahl, and easier still to not even
          realize which of these libraries you are using, folks should
          be aware that SVNKit differs from javahl in some significant
          ways.  First, while SVNKit is developed as open source
          software just like Subversion, SVNKit's license is more
          restrictive than that of
          Subversion.<sup>[<a id="idp42646448" href="#ftn.idp42646448" class="footnote">70</a>]</sup>  Finally, by aiming to be a
          pure Java Subversion library, SVNKit is limited in which
          portions of Subversion can be reasonably cloned while still
          keeping up with Subversion's releases.  This has already
          happened onceâSVNKit cannot access BDB-backed
          Subversion repositories via the <code class="literal">file://</code>
          protocol because there's no pure Java implementation of
          Berkeley DB that is file-format-compatible with the native
          implementation of that library.</p><p>That said, SVNKit has a well-established track record of
          reliability.  And a pure Java solution is much more robust
          in the face of programming errorsâa bug in SVNKit
          might raise a catchable Java Exception, but a bug in the
          Subversion core libraries as accessed via javahl can bring
          down your entire Java Runtime Environment.  So, weigh the
          costs when choosing a Java-based Subversion
          implementation.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Code Samples"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.developer.usingapi.codesamples"></a>Code Samples</h3></div></div></div><p><a class="xref" href="#svn.developer.layerlib.repos.ex-1" title="ExampleÂ 8.1.Â Using the repository layer">ExampleÂ 8.1, âUsing the repository layerâ</a>
        contains a code segment (written in C) that illustrates some
        of the concepts we've been discussing.  It uses both the
        repository and filesystem interfaces (as can be determined by
        the prefixes <code class="literal">svn_repos_</code> and
        <code class="literal">svn_fs_</code> of the function names,
        respectively) to create a new revision in which a directory is
        added.  You can see the use of an APR pool, which is passed
        around for memory allocation purposes.  Also, the code reveals
        a somewhat obscure fact about Subversion error
        handlingâall Subversion errors must be explicitly
        handled to avoid memory leakage (and in some cases,
        application failure).</p><div class="example"><a id="svn.developer.layerlib.repos.ex-1"></a><p class="title"><strong>ExampleÂ 8.1.Â Using the repository layer</strong></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">

          them to other API functions.  Failure to do so can trigger
          assertions in the underlying Subversion C library which
          translate into rather immediate and unceremonious program
          abortion.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>Of particular interest to users of the Python flavor of
        Subversion's API is the implementation of callback functions.
        As previously mentioned, Subversion's C API makes liberal use
        of the callback function/baton paradigm.  API functions which
        in C accept a function and baton pair only accept a callback
        function parameter in Python.  How, then, does the caller pass
        arbitrary context information to the callback function?  In
        Python, this is done by taking advantage of Python's scoping
        rules and default argument values.  You can see this in action
        in <a class="xref" href="#svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs.ex-2" title="ExampleÂ 8.3.Â A Python status crawler">ExampleÂ 8.3, âA Python status crawlerâ</a>.
        The <code class="function">svn_client_status2()</code> function is
        given a callback function
        (<code class="function">_status_callback()</code>) but no
        batonâ<code class="function">_status_callback()</code> gets
        access to the user-provided prefix string because that
        variable falls into the scope of the function
        automatically.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.developer.summary"></a>Summary</h2></div></div></div><p>One of Subversion's greatest features isn't something you
      get from running its command-line client or other tools.  It's
      the fact that Subversion was designed modularly and provides a
      stable, public API so that othersâlike yourself,
      perhapsâcan write custom software that drives Subversion's
      core logic.</p><p>In this chapter, we took a closer look at Subversion's
      architecture, examining its logical layers and describing that
      public API, the very same API that Subversion's own layers use
      to communicate with each other.  Many developers have found
      interesting uses for the Subversion API, from simple repository
      hook scripts, to integrations between Subversion and some other
      application, to completely different version control systems.

    Subversion.  It includes command summaries and examples for all
    the command-line tools provided as part of the stock Subversion
    distribution, configuration information for the Subversion server
    modules, and other information that lends itself to a reference
    format.</p><div class="sect1" title="svnâSubversion Command-Line Client"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.ref.svn"></a>svnâSubversion Command-Line Client</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> is the official command-line client
      of Subversion.  Its functionality is offered via a collection of
      task-specific subcommands, most of which accept a number of
      options for fine-grained control of the program's
      behavior.</p><p>When using the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program, subcommands
      and other non-option arguments must appear in a specified order
      on the command line.  Options, on the other hand, may appear
      anywhere on the command line (after the program name, of
      course), and in general, their order is irrelevant.  For
      example, all of the following are valid ways to use <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span>, and are interpreted in exactly the same
      way:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn -vq status myfile
$ svn status -v -q myfile
$ svn -q status -v myfile
$ svn status -vq myfile
$ svn status myfile -qv
</pre></div><p>The following sections describe each of the various
      subcommands and options provided by the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
      command-line client program, including some examples of each
      subcommand's typical uses.</p><div class="sect2" title="svn Options"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.ref.svn.sw"></a>svn Options</h3></div></div></div><p>While Subversion has different options for its
        subcommands, all options exist in a single
        namespaceâthat is, each option is guaranteed to mean the
        roughly same thing regardless of the subcommand you use it
        with.  For example, <code class="option">--verbose</code>
        (<code class="option">-v</code>) always means <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">verbose
        output,</span>â</span> regardless of the subcommand you use it
        with.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> command-line client usually
        exits quickly with an error if you pass it an option which
        does not apply to the specified subcommand.  But as of
        Subversion 1.5, several of the options which apply to
        allâor nearly allâof the subcommands have been
        deemed acceptable by all subcommands, even if they have no
        effect on some of them.  (This change was made primarily to
        improve the client's ability to called from custom wrapping
        scripts.)  These options appear grouped together in the
        command-line client's usage messages as global options, as can
        be seen in the following bit of output:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn help upgrade
upgrade: Upgrade the metadata storage format for a working copy.
usage: upgrade [WCPATH...]

  Local modifications are preserved.

Valid options:

</pre></div><p>Prior to version 1.7, Subversion would complain by
            default if you try to check out a directory atop an
            existing directory which contains files or subdirectories
            that the checkout itself would have created.  Subversion
            1.7 handles this situation differently, allowing the
            checkout to proceed but marking any obstructing objects as
            tree conflicts.  Use the <code class="option">--force</code> option
            to override this safeguard.  When you check out with
            the <code class="option">--force</code> option, any unversioned file
            in the checkout target tree which ordinarily would
            obstruct the checkout will still become versioned, but
            Subversion will preserve its contents as-is.  If those
            contents differ from the repository file at that path
            (which was downloaded as part of the checkout), the file
            will appear to have local modificationsâthe changes
            required to transform the versioned file you checked out
            into the unversioned file you had before checking
            outâwhen the checkout completes.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>You can avoid the clutter of the double dashed lines
            in your output by using the <code class="option">--incremental</code>
            option:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

            if <em class="replaceable"><code>WCPATH</code></em> is omitted, the
            changes are applied to the current working directory.  A
            unidiff patch suitable for application to a working copy
            can be produced with the <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>
            command or third-party differencing tools.  Any
            non-unidiff content found in the patch file is
            ignored.</p><p>Changes listed in the patch file will either be
            applied or rejected.  If a change does not match at its
            exact line offset, it may be applied earlier or later in
            the file if a match is found elsewhere for the surrounding
            lines of context provided by the patch.  A change may also
            be applied with <em class="firstterm">fuzz</em>âmeaning,
            one or more lines of context are ignored when attempting
            to match the change location.  If no matching context can
            be found for a change, the change conflicts and will be
            written to a reject file which bears the extension

            notification.  The letter codes have the following

            symbol. You should review such changes carefully.</p><p>If the patch removes all content from a file, that
            file is automatically scheduled for deletion.  Likewise,
            if the patch creates a new file, that file is
            automatically scheduled for addition.  Use <span class="command"><strong>svn

            (or apparent location, from the client's perspective) of a
            repository.  The content of the repository doesn't change,
            but the repository's root URL does.  The hostname may
            change because the repository is now being served from a
            different computer.  Or, perhaps the URL scheme changes
            because the repository is now being served via SSL
            (using <code class="literal">https://</code>) instead of over plain
            HTTP.  There are many different reasons for these types of
            repository relocations.  But ideally, a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">change of
            address</span>â</span> for a repository shouldn't suddently cause
            all the working copies which point to that repository to
            become forever unusable.  And fortunately, that's not the
            case.  Rather than force users to check out a new working
            copy when a repository is relocated, Subversion provides
            the <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> command, which 
            <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">rewrites</span>â</span> the working copy's administrative
            metadata to refer to the new repository location.</p><p>The first <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> syntax
            allows you to update one or more working copies by what
            essentially amounts to a find-and-replace within the
            repository root URLs recorded in those working copies.
            Subversion will replace the initial substring
            <em class="replaceable"><code>FROM-PREFIX</code></em> with the
            string <em class="replaceable"><code>TO-PREFIX</code></em> in those URLs.
            These initial URL substrings can be as long or as short as
            is necessary to differentiate between them.  Obviously, to
            use this syntax form, you need to know both the current
            root URL of the repository to which the working copy is
            pointing, and the new URL of that repository.
            (You can use <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> to determine
            the former.)</p><p>The second syntax does not require that you know the
            current repository root URL with which the working copy is
            associated at allâonly the new repository URL
            (<em class="replaceable"><code>TO-URL</code></em>) to which it should be
            pointing.  In this syntax form, only one working copy may
            be relocated at a time.</p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png"></img></td><th align="left">Warning</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Users often get confused about the difference

            are told the new URL.  Rather than checkout a new working
            copy, though, we simply ask Subversion to rewrite the
            working copy metadata to point to the new repository
            location.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

              affects <span class="emphasis"><em>working copy metadata only</em></span>.
              It will not change your versioned or unversioned file
              contents, perform any version control operations (such
              as commits or updates), and so on.</p></td></tr></table></div><p>A few months later, we're told that the company is
            moving development to separate machines and that we'll be
            using HTTP to access the repository.  So we relocate our
            working copy again.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate http://svn.company.com/repos/trunk
$
</pre></div><p>Now, each time we perform a relocation of this sort,
            Subversion contacts the repositoryâat its new URL,
            of courseâto verify a few things.</p><p>First, it wants to compare the UUID of the repository
            against what is stored in the working copy.  If these UUIDs
            don't match, the working copy relocation is disallowed.
            Maybe this isn't the same repository (just in a new
            location) after all?</p><p>Secondly, Subversion wants to ensure that the updated
            working copy metadata jives with respect to the directory
            location <span class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the repository.
            Subversion won't let you accidentally relocate a working
            copy of a branch in your repository to the URL of a
            different branch in the same repository.  (That's
            what <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, described in
            <a class="xref" href="#svn.ref.svn.c.switch" title="svn switch (sw)">svn switch (sw)</a>, is for.)</p><p>Also, Subversion will not allow you to relocate a
            subtree of the working copy.  If you're going to relocate
            the working copy at all, you must relocate the whole
            thing.  This is to protect the integrity of the working
            copy metadata and behavior as a whole.  (And really, you'd
            be hard pressed to come up with a compelling reason to
            relocate only a piece of your working copy anyway.)</p><p>Let's look at one final relocation opportunity.  After
            using HTTP access for some time, the company moves to
            SSL-only access.  Now, the only change to the repository
            URL is that the scheme goes from
            being <code class="literal">http://</code> to
            being <code class="literal">https://</code>.  There are two
            different ways that we could make our working copy reflect
            ths change.  The first is to do exactly as we've done
            before and relocate to the new repository URL.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate https://svn.company.com/repos/trunk
$
</pre></div><p>But we have another option here, too.  We could simply
            ask Subversion to swap out the changed prefixes of the
            URL.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn relocate http https
$
</pre></div><p>Either approach leaves us a working copy whose
            metadata has been updated to point to the right repository
            location.</p><p>By default, <span class="command"><strong>svn relocate</strong></span> will
            traverse any external working copies nested within your
            working copy and attempt relocation of those working
            copies, too.  Use the <code class="option">--ignore-externals</code>

            for a practical use.</p><p>By default, the Subversion dump stream contains a
            single revision (the first revision in the requested
            revision range) in which every file and directory in the
            repository in that revision is presented as though that whole
            tree was added at once, followed by other revisions (the
            remainder of the revisions in the requested range), which
            contain only the files and directories that were modified
            in those revisions.  For a modified file, the complete
            full-text representation of its contents, as well as all of
            its properties, are presented in the dump file; for a
            directory, all of its properties are presented.</p><p>Two useful options modify the dump file
            generator's behavior.  The first is the
            <code class="option">--incremental</code> option, which simply causes
            that first revision in the dump stream to contain only
            the files and directories modified in that revision,
            instead of being presented as the addition of a new tree,
            and in exactly the same way that every other revision in
            the dump file is presented.  This is useful for generating
            a relatively small dump file to be loaded into another
            repository that already has the files and directories
            that exist in the original repository.</p><p>The second useful option is <code class="option">--deltas</code>.
            This option causes <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> to,
            instead of emitting full-text representations of file
            contents and property lists, emit only deltas of those
            items against their previous versions.  This reduces (in
            some cases, drastically) the size of the dump file that
            <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin dump</strong></span> creates.  There are, however,
            disadvantages to using this optionâdeltified
            dump files are more CPU-intensive to create, cannot be
            operated on by <span class="command"><strong>svndumpfilter</strong></span>, and tend
            not to compress as well as their nondeltified counterparts
            when using third-party tools such as <span class="command"><strong>gzip</strong></span>
            and <span class="command"><strong>bzip2</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Options"><a id="idp44673120"></a><h2>Options</h2><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">

            regarding the format of the values of Subversion's own
            built-in properties.  Of course, properties created with
            older versions of Subversion wouldn't have benefitted from
            that strictness, and as such might be improperly
            formatted.  Dump streams carry property values as-is, so
            using Subversion 1.7 to load dump streams created from
            repositories with ill-formatted property values will, by
            default, trigger a validation error.  There are several
            workaround for this problem.  First, you can manually
            repair the problematic property values in the source
            repository and recreate the dump stream.  Or, you can
            manually tweak the dump stream itself to fix those
            property values.  Finally, if you'd rather not deal with

            repository meets the basic requirements of a new mirror
            repository and records the initial administrative
            information that associates the mirror repository with the
            source repository (specified
            by <em class="replaceable"><code>SOURCE_URL</code></em>).  This is the
            first <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> operation you run on a
            would-be mirror repository.</p><p>Ordinarily, <em class="replaceable"><code>SOURCE_URL</code></em> is
            the URL of the root directory of the Subversion repository
            you wish to mirror.  Subversion 1.5 and newer allow you to
            use <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> for partial repository
            mirroring, though â simply specify the URL of the
            source repository subdirectory you wish to mirror
            as <em class="replaceable"><code>SOURCE_URL</code></em>.</p><p>By default, the aforementioned basic requirements of a
            mirror are that it allows revision property modifications
            and that it contains no version history.  However, as of
            Subversion 1.7, you may now optionally disable the
            verification that the target repository is empty using
            the <code class="option">--allow-non-empty</code> option.  While the
            use of this option should not become habitual (as it
            bypasses a valuable safeguard mechanism), it does aid in
            one very common use-case: initializing a copy of a
            repository as a mirror of the original.  This is
            especially handy when setting up new mirrors of
            repositories which contain a large amount of version
            history.  Rather than initialize a brand new repository as
            a mirror and then syncronize all of the history into it,
            administrators will find it <span class="emphasis"><em>significantly</em></span>
            faster to first make a copy of the mature repository
            (perhaps using <span class="command"><strong>svnadmin hotcopy</strong></span>) and
            then use <span class="command"><strong>svnsync initialize
            --allow-non-empty</strong></span> to initialize that copy as a
            mirror which is now already up-to-date with the

      APRâthe Apache Portable Runtime library.  The APR library
      provides all the interfaces that Subversion needs to function on
      different operating systems: disk access, network access, memory
      management, and so on.  While Subversion is able to use Apache
      HTTP Server (or, <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span>) as one of its network
      server programs, its dependence on APR <span class="emphasis"><em>does
      not</em></span> mean that <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> is a required
      component.  APR is a standalone library usable by any
      application.  It does mean, however, that Subversion clients and
      servers run on any operating system
      that <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> runs on: Windows, Linux, all
      flavors of BSD, Mac OS X, NetWare, and others.</p><p>The easiest way to get Subversion is to download a binary
      package built for your operating system.  Subversion's web site
      (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org</a>) often has these
      packages available for download, posted by volunteers.  The site
      usually contains graphical installer packages for users of
      Microsoft operating systems.  If you run a Unix-like operating
      system, you can use your system's native package distribution
      system (RPMs, DEBs, the ports tree, etc.) to get
      Subversion.</p><p>Alternatively, you can build Subversion directly from source
      code, though it's not always an easy task. (If you're not
      experienced at building open source software packages, you're
      probably better off downloading a binary distribution instead!)
      From the Subversion web site, download the latest source code
      release.  After unpacking it, follow the instructions in
      the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file to build it.</p><p>If you're one of those folks that likes to use bleeding-edge
      software, you can also get the Subversion source code from the
      Subversion repository in which it lives.  Obviously, you'll need

      collection of database files.  You won't see your versioned

      creation and maintenance, see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin" title="ChapterÂ 5.Â Repository Administration">ChapterÂ 5, <em>Repository Administration</em></a>.</p><p>Subversion has no concept of a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">project.</span>â</span> The
      repository is just a virtual versioned filesystem, a large tree
      that can hold anything you wish.  Some administrators prefer to
      store only one project in a repository, and others prefer to
      store multiple projects in a repository by placing them into
      separate directories.  We discuss the merits of each approach
      in <a class="xref" href="#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="Planning Your Repository Organization">the section called âPlanning Your Repository Organizationâ</a>.
      Either way, the repository manages only files and directories,
      so it's up to humans to interpret particular directories as
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">projects.</span>â</span>  So while you might see references to
      projects throughout this book, keep in mind that we're only ever
      talking about some directory (or collection of directories) in
      the repository.</p><p>In this example, we assume you already have some sort
      of project (a collection of files and directories) that you wish
      to import into your newly created Subversion repository.  Begin
      by organizing your data into a single directory called
      <code class="filename">myproject</code> (or whatever you wish).  For
      reasons explained in <a class="xref" href="#svn.branchmerge" title="ChapterÂ 4.Â Branching and Merging">ChapterÂ 4, <em>Branching and Merging</em></a>, your
      project's tree structure should contain three top-level
      directories named <code class="filename">branches</code>,
      <code class="filename">tags</code>, and <code class="filename">trunk</code>.  The
      <code class="filename">trunk</code> directory should contain all of your
      data, and the <code class="filename">branches</code> and
      <code class="filename">tags</code> directories should be empty:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br></br>

      and <code class="filename">trunk</code> subdirectories aren't actually
      required by Subversion.  They're merely a popular convention
      that you'll most likely want to use later on.</p><p>Once you have your tree of data ready to go, import it into
      the repository with the <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> command

    It's essentially a list of differences between the two systems
    as <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">viewed from 10,000 feet.</span>â</span>  For each section, we
    provide references to relevant chapters when
    possible.</p><p>Although the goal of Subversion is to take over the current
    and future CVS user base, some new features and design changes
    were required to fix certain <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">broken</span>â</span> behaviors
    that CVS had.  This means that, as a CVS user, you may need to
    break habitsâones that you forgot were odd to begin
    with.</p><div class="sect1" title="Revision Numbers Are Different Now"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.revnums"></a>Revision Numbers Are Different Now</h2></div></div></div><p>In CVS, revision numbers are per file.  This is because CVS
      stores its data in RCS files; each file has a corresponding RCS
      file in the repository, and the repository is roughly laid out
      according to the structure of your project tree.</p><p>In Subversion, the repository looks like a single
      filesystem.  Each commit results in an entirely new filesystem
      tree; in essence, the repository is an array of trees.  Each of
      these trees is labeled with a single revision number.  When
      someone talks about <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revision 54</span>â</span>, he's talking
      about a particular tree (and indirectly, the way the filesystem
      looked after the 54th commit).</p><p>Technically, it's not valid to talk about <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revision 5
      of <code class="filename">foo.c</code>.</span>â</span>  Instead, one would say
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in revision
      5.</span>â</span>  Also, be careful when making assumptions about the
      evolution of a file.  In CVS, revisions 5 and 6 of
      <code class="filename">foo.c</code> are always different.  In Subversion,
      it's most likely that <code class="filename">foo.c</code> did
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> change between revisions 5 and
      6.</p><p>Similarly, in CVS, a tag or branch is an annotation on the
      file or on the version information for that individual file,
      whereas in Subversion, a tag or branch is a copy of an entire
      tree (by convention, into the <code class="filename">/branches</code>
      or <code class="filename">/tags</code> directories that appear at the top
      level of the repository, beside <code class="filename">/trunk</code>).  In
      the repository as a whole, many versions of each file may be
      visible: the latest version on each branch, every tagged
      version, and of course the latest version on the trunk
      itself.  So, to refine the terms even further, one would often
      say <span class="quote">â<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in
      <code class="filename">/branches/REL1</code> in revision
      5.</span>â</span></p><p>For more details on this topic, see <a class="xref" href="#svn.basic.in-action.revs" title="Revisions">the section called âRevisionsâ</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Directory Versions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.directories"></a>Directory Versions</h2></div></div></div><p>Subversion tracks tree structures, not just file contents.
      It's one of the biggest reasons Subversion was written to
      replace CVS.</p><p>Here's what this means to you, as a former CVS user:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
          delete</strong></span> commands work on directories now, just as
          they work on files.  So do <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> and
          <span class="command"><strong>svn move</strong></span>.  However, these commands do
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> cause any kind of immediate change
          in the repository.  Instead, the working items are simply
          <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">scheduled</span>â</span> for addition or deletion.  No
          repository changes happen until you run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
          commit</code></strong>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Directories aren't dumb containers anymore; they have
          revision numbers like files.  (Or more properly, it's
          correct to talk about <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">directory
          <code class="filename">foo/</code> in revision 5.</span>â</span>)</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's talk more about that last point.  Directory versioning
      is a hard problem; because we want to allow mixed-revision
      working copies, there are some limitations on how far we can
      abuse this model.</p><p>From a theoretical point of view, we define <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">revision
      5 of directory <code class="filename">foo</code></span>â</span> to mean a
      specific collection of directory entries and properties.  Now
      suppose we start adding and removing files from
      <code class="filename">foo</code>, and then commit.  It would be a lie
      to say that we still have revision 5 of
      <code class="filename">foo</code>.  However, if we bumped
      <code class="filename">foo</code>'s revision number after the commit,
      that would be a lie too; there may be other changes to
      <code class="filename">foo</code> we haven't yet received, because we
      haven't updated yet.</p><p>Subversion deals with this problem by quietly tracking
      committed adds and deletes in the <code class="filename">.svn</code>
      area.  When you eventually run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn update</code></strong>,
      all accounts are settled with the repository, and the
      directory's new revision number is set correctly.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore, only after an update is it truly safe to
      say that you have a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">perfect</span>â</span> revision of a
      directory.</em></span> Most of the time, your working copy will
      contain <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">imperfect</span>â</span> directory revisions.</p><p>Similarly, a problem arises if you attempt to commit
      property changes on a directory.  Normally, the commit would
      bump the working directory's local revision number.  But again,
      that would be a lie, as there may be adds or deletes that
      the directory doesn't yet have, because no update has happened.
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore, you are not allowed to commit
      property changes on a directory unless the directory is
      up to date.</em></span></p><p>For more discussion about the limitations of directory

      and abundant, but network bandwidth has not.  Therefore, the
      Subversion working copy has been optimized around the scarcer
      resource.</p><p>The <code class="filename">.svn</code> administrative directory
      serves the same purpose as the <code class="filename">CVS</code>
      directory, except that it also stores read-only,
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">pristine</span>â</span> copies of your files.  This allows you
      to do many things offline:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Shows you any local changes you've made (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.examine.status" title="See an overview of your changes">the section called âSee an overview of your changesâ</a>)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Shows you the details of your changes (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.examine.diff" title="Examine the details of your local modifications">the section called âExamine the details of your local modificationsâ</a>)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Removes your local changes (see <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.revert" title="Fix Your Mistakes">the section called âFix Your Mistakesâ</a>)</p></dd></dl></div><p>Also, the cached pristine files allow the Subversion client
      to send differences when committing, which CVS cannot do.</p><p>The last subcommand in the listâ<span class="command"><strong>svn
      revert</strong></span>âis new.  It will not only remove local
      changes, but also unschedule operations such as adds and
      deletes.  Although deleting the file and then running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn
      update</code></strong> will still work, doing so distorts the true
      purpose of updating.  And, while we're on this subjectâ¦</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Distinction Between Status and Update"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.status-vs-update"></a>Distinction Between Status and Update</h2></div></div></div><p>Subversion attempts to erase a lot of the confusion
      between the <span class="command"><strong>cvs status</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>cvs update</strong></span> commands.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>cvs status</strong></span> command has two purposes:
      first, to show the user any local modifications in the working
      copy, and second, to show the user which files are out of date.
      Unfortunately, because of CVS's hard-to-read status output, many
      CVS users don't take advantage of this command at all.  Instead,
      they've developed a habit of running <strong class="userinput"><code>cvs
      update</code></strong> or <strong class="userinput"><code>cvs -n update</code></strong> to quickly
      see their changes.  If users forget to use
      the <code class="option">-n</code> option, this has the side effect of
      merging repository changes they may not be ready to deal
      with.</p><p>Subversion removes this muddle by making the output of
      <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> easy to read for both humans and
      parsers.  Also, <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> prints only
      information about files that are updated,
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> local modifications.</p><div class="sect2" title="Status"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.forcvs.status-vs-update.status"></a>Status</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> prints all files that have
        local modifications.  By default, the repository is not
        contacted.  While this subcommand accepts a fair number of
        options, the following are the most commonly used ones:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-u</code></span></dt><dd><p>Contact the repository to determine, and then display,
              out-of-dateness information.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-v</code></span></dt><dd><p>Show <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> entries under
              version control.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-N</code></span></dt><dd><p>Run nonrecursively (do not descend into
              subdirectories).</p></dd></dl></div><p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> command has two output
        formats.  In the default <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">short</span>â</span> format, local
        modifications look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status
M       foo.c
M       bar/baz.c
</pre></div><p>If you specify the <code class="option">--show-updates</code>
        (<code class="option">-u</code>) option, a longer output format is
        used:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ svn status -u
M             1047   foo.c
        *     1045   faces.html
        *            bloo.png
M             1050   bar/baz.c
Status against revision:   1066
</pre></div><p>In this case, two new columns appear.  The second column
        contains an asterisk if the file or directory is out of date.
        The third column shows the working copy's revision number of the
        item.  In the previous example, the asterisk indicates that
        <code class="filename">faces.html</code> would be patched if we updated,
        and that <code class="filename">bloo.png</code> is a newly added file in
        the repository.  (The absence of any revision number next to

      markers,</span>â</span> and then prints a <code class="literal">C</code> during
      an update or merge operation.  Historically, this has caused
      problems, because CVS isn't doing enough.  Many users forget
      about (or don't see) the <code class="literal">C</code> after it whizzes
      by on their terminal.  They often forget that the conflict
      markers are even present, and then accidentally commit files
      containing those conflict markers.</p><p>Subversion solves this problem in a pair of ways.  First,
      when a conflict occurs in a file, Subversion records the fact
      that the file is in a state of conflict, and won't allow you to
      commit changes to that file until you explicitly resolve the
      conflict.  Second, Subversion provides interactive conflict
      resolution, which allows you to resolve conflicts as they happen
      instead of having to go back and do so after the update or merge
      operation completes.  See <a class="xref" href="#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="Resolve Any Conflicts">the section called âResolve Any Conflictsâ</a> for more about conflict resolution in Subversion.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Binary Files and Translation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.binary-and-trans"></a>Binary Files and Translation</h2></div></div></div><p>In the most general sense, Subversion handles binary files
      more gracefully than CVS does.  Because CVS uses RCS, it can
      only store successive full copies of a changing binary file.
      Subversion, however, expresses differences between files using a
      binary differencing algorithm, regardless of whether they
      contain textual or binary data.  That means all files are
      stored differentially (compressed) in the repository.</p><p>CVS users have to mark binary files with
      <code class="option">-kb</code> flags to prevent data from being
      garbled (due to keyword expansion and line-ending translations).
      They sometimes forget to do this.</p><p>Subversion takes the more paranoid route.  First, it never
      performs any kind of keyword or line-ending translation unless
      you explicitly ask it to do so (see
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.keywords" title="Keyword Substitution">the section called âKeyword Substitutionâ</a> and
      <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style" title="End-of-Line Character Sequences">the section called âEnd-of-Line Character Sequencesâ</a> for more
      details).  By default, Subversion treats all file data as
      literal byte strings, and files are always stored in the
      repository in an untranslated state.</p><p>Second, Subversion maintains an internal notion of whether a
      file is <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">text</span>â</span> or <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">binary</span>â</span> data, but
      this notion is <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> extant in the working
      copy.  During an <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, Subversion will
      perform contextual merges on locally modified text files, but
      will not attempt to do so for binary files.</p><p>To determine whether a contextual merge is possible,
      Subversion examines the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
      property.  If the file has no <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
      property, or has a MIME type that is textual (e.g.,
      <code class="literal">text/*</code>),
      Subversion assumes it is text.  Otherwise, Subversion assumes
      the file is binary.  Subversion also helps users by running a
      binary-detection algorithm in the <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span>
      and <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> commands.  These commands will
      make a good guess and then (possibly) set a binary
      <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on the file being
      added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, the user can always remove
      or hand-edit the property.)</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Versioned Modules"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.modules"></a>Versioned Modules</h2></div></div></div><p>Unlike CVS, a Subversion working copy is aware that it has
      checked out a module.  That means if somebody changes the
      definition of a module (e.g., adds or removes components), a
      call to <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> will update the working
      copy appropriately, adding and removing components.</p><p>Subversion defines modules as a list of directories within a
      directory property; see <a class="xref" href="#svn.advanced.externals" title="Externals Definitions">the section called âExternals Definitionsâ</a>.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Authentication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.auth"></a>Authentication</h2></div></div></div><p>With CVS's pserver, you are required to log in to the server
      (using the <span class="command"><strong>cvs login</strong></span> command) before
      performing any read or write operationâyou sometimes even
      have to log in for anonymous operations.  With a Subversion
      repository using Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> or
      <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> as the server, you don't provide any
      authentication credentials at the outsetâif an operation
      that you perform requires authentication, the server will
      challenge you for your credentials (whether those credentials
      are username and password, a client certificate, or even both).
      So if your repository is world-readable, you will not be
      required to authenticate at all for read operations.</p><p>As with CVS, Subversion still caches your credentials on
      disk (in your <code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code>
      directory) unless you tell it not to by using the
      <code class="option">--no-auth-cache</code> option.</p><p>The exception to this behavior, however, is in the case of
      accessing an <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> server over an SSH
      tunnel, using the <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URL scheme.  In
      that case, the <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span> program unconditionally
      demands authentication just to start the tunnel.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Converting a Repository from CVS to Subversion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.forcvs.convert"></a>Converting a Repository from CVS to Subversion</h2></div></div></div><p>Perhaps the most important way to familiarize CVS users with
      Subversion is to let them continue to work on their projects
      using the new system.  And while that can be somewhat
      accomplished using a flat import into a Subversion repository of
      an exported CVS repository, the more thorough solution involves
      transferring not just the latest snapshot of their data, but all
      the history behind it as well, from one system to another.  This
      is an extremely difficult problem to solve; it involves
      deducing changesets in the absence of atomicity and translating
      between the systems' completely orthogonal branching policies,
      among other complications.  Still, a handful of tools claim
      to at least partially support the ability to convert
      existing CVS repositories into Subversion ones.</p><p>The most popular (and mature) conversion tool is
      cvs2svn (<a class="ulink" href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/</a>), a Python
      program originally created by members of Subversion's own
      development community.  This tool is meant to run exactly once:
      it scans your CVS repository multiple times and attempts to
      deduce commits, branches, and tags as best it can.  When it
      finishes, the result is either a Subversion repository or a
      portable Subversion dump file representing your code's history.

    popular as a standard for file sharing.  Today's operating systems
    are becoming extremely web-aware, and many now have built-in
    support for mounting <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">shares</span>â</span> exported by WebDAV
    servers.</p><p>If you use Apache as your Subversion network server, to
    some extent you are also running a WebDAV server.  This appendix
    gives some background on the nature of this protocol, how
    Subversion uses it, and how well Subversion interoperates with
    other software that is WebDAV-aware.</p><div class="sect1" title="What Is WebDAV?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.webdav.basic"></a>What Is WebDAV?</h2></div></div></div><p><em class="firstterm">DAV</em> stands for <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Distributed
      Authoring and Versioning.</span>â</span>  RFC 2518 defines a set of
      concepts and accompanying extension methods to HTTP 1.1 that
      make the Web a more universal read/write medium.  The basic
      idea is that a WebDAV-compliant web server can act like a
      generic file server; clients can <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mount</span>â</span> shared
      folders over HTTP that behave much like other network
      filesystems (such as NFS or SMB).</p><p>The tragedy, though, is that despite the acronym, the RFC
      specification doesn't actually describe any sort of version
      control.  Basic WebDAV clients and servers assume that only one
      version of each file or directory exists, and that it can be
      repeatedly overwritten.</p><p>Because RFC 2518 left out versioning concepts, another
      committee was left with the responsibility of writing RFC 3253 a
      few years later.  The new RFC adds versioning concepts to
      WebDAV, placing the <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">V</span>â</span> back in
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">DAV</span>â</span>âhence the term <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">DeltaV.</span>â</span>
      WebDAV/DeltaV clients and servers are often called just
      <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">DeltaV</span>â</span> programs, since DeltaV implies the
      existence of basic WebDAV.</p><p>The original WebDAV standard has been widely successful.
      Every modern computer operating system has a general WebDAV
      client built in (details to follow), and a number of popular
      standalone applications are also able to speak
      WebDAVâMicrosoft Office, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop, to
      name a few.  On the server end, Apache HTTP Server has been
      able to provide WebDAV services since 1998 and is considered the
      de facto open source standard.  Several other
      commercial WebDAV servers are available, including Microsoft's own
      IIS.</p><p>DeltaV, unfortunately, has not been so successful.  It's
      very difficult to find any DeltaV clients or servers.  The few
      that do exist are relatively unknown commercial products, and
      thus it's very difficult to test interoperability.  It's not
      entirely clear as to why DeltaV has remained stagnant.  Some
      opine that the specification is just too complex.  Others argue
      that while WebDAV's features have mass appeal (even the least
      technical users appreciate network file sharing), its version
      control features just aren't interesting or necessary for most
      users.  Finally, some believe that DeltaV remains unpopular
      because there's still no open source server product that
      implements it well.</p><p>When Subversion was still in its design phase, it seemed
      like a great idea to use Apache as a network server.  It already
      had a module to provide WebDAV services.  DeltaV was a
      relatively new specification.  The hope was that the Subversion
      server module (<span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>) would eventually
      evolve into an open source DeltaV reference implementation.
      Unfortunately, DeltaV has a very specific versioning model that
      doesn't quite line up with Subversion's model.  Some concepts
      were mappable; others were not.</p><p>What does this mean, then?</p><p>First, the Subversion client is not a fully implemented
      DeltaV client.  It needs certain types of things from the server
      that DeltaV itself cannot provide, and thus is largely dependent
      on a number of Subversion-specific
      HTTP <code class="literal">REPORT</code> requests that
      only <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> understands.</p><p>Second, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> is not a
      fully realized DeltaV server.  Many portions of the DeltaV
      specification were irrelevant to Subversion, and thus were left
      unimplemented.</p><p>A long-held debate in the Subversion developer community
      about whether it was worthfile to remedy either of these
      situations eventually reached closure, with the Subversion
      developers officially deciding to abandon plans to fully support
      DeltaV.  As of Subversion 1.7, Subversion clients and servers
      introduce numerous non-standard simplifications of the DeltaV
      standards<sup>[<a id="idp49848480" href="#ftn.idp49848480" class="footnote">75</a>]</sup>, with more
      customizations of this sort likely to come.  Those versions of
      Subversion will, of course, continue to provide the same DeltaV
      feature support already present in older releases, but no new
      work will be done to increase coverage of the
      specificationâSubversion is intentionally moving away from
      strict DeltaV as its primary HTTP-based protocol.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Autoversioning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.webdav.autoversioning"></a>Autoversioning</h2></div></div></div><p>While the Subversion client is not a full DeltaV client, and
      the Subversion server is not a full DeltaV server, there's still a
      glimmer of WebDAV interoperability to be happy about:
      <em class="firstterm">autoversioning</em>.</p><p>Autoversioning is an optional feature defined in the DeltaV
      standard.  A typical DeltaV server will reject an ignorant
      WebDAV client attempting to do a <code class="literal">PUT</code> to a
      file that's under version control.  To change a
      version-controlled file, the server expects a series of proper
      versioning requests: something like
      <code class="literal">MKACTIVITY</code>, <code class="literal">CHECKOUT</code>,
      <code class="literal">PUT</code>, <code class="literal">CHECKIN</code>.  But if the
      DeltaV server supports autoversioning, write requests from
      basic WebDAV clients are accepted.  The server behaves as though the
      client <span class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> issued the proper series of
      versioning requests, performing a commit under the hood.  In
      other words, it allows a DeltaV server to interoperate with
      ordinary WebDAV clients that don't understand versioning.</p><p>Because so many operating systems already have integrated
      WebDAV clients, the use case for this feature can be incredibly
      appealing to administrators working with non-technical users.
      Imagine an office of ordinary users running Microsoft Windows or
      Mac OS.  Each user <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">mounts</span>â</span> the Subversion
      repository, which appears to be an ordinary network folder.
      They use the shared folder as they always do:  open files, edit
      them, and save them.  Meanwhile, the server is automatically
      versioning everything.  Any administrator (or knowledgeable
      user) can still use a Subversion client to search history and
      retrieve older versions of data.</p><p>This scenario isn't fictionâit's real and it works.
      To activate autoversioning in <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>,
      use the <code class="literal">SVNAutoversioning</code> directive within
      the <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> <code class="literal">Location</code>
      block, like so:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>When Subversion autoversioning is active, write requests
      from WebDAV clients result in automatic commits.  A generic log
      message is automatically generated and attached to each
      revision.</p><p>Before activating this feature, however, understand what
      you're getting into.  WebDAV clients tend to do
      <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> write requests, resulting in a huge
      number of automatically committed revisions.  For example, when
      saving data, many clients will do a <code class="literal">PUT</code> of a
      0-byte file (as a way of reserving a name) followed by another
      <code class="literal">PUT</code> with the real file data.  The single
      file-write results in two separate commits.  Also consider that
      many applications auto-save every few minutes, resulting in even
      more commits.</p><p>If you have a post-commit hook program that sends email, you
      may want to disable email generation either altogether or on
      certain sections of the repository; it depends on whether you
      think the influx of emails will still prove to be valuable
      notifications or not.  Also, a smart post-commit hook program
      can distinguish between a transaction created via autoversioning
      and one created through a normal Subversion commit operation.
      The trick is to look for a revision property
      named <code class="literal">svn:autoversioned</code>.  If present, the
      commit was made by a generic WebDAV client.</p><p>Another feature that may be a useful complement for
      Subversion's autoversioning comes from Apache's
      <code class="literal">mod_mime</code> module.  If a WebDAV client adds a
      new file to the repository, there's no opportunity for the user
      to set the the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.  This
      might cause the file to appear as a generic icon when viewed
      within a WebDAV shared folder, not having an association with
      any application.  One remedy is to have a sysadmin (or other
      Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a working copy and
      manually set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on
      necessary files.  But there's potentially no end to such cleanup
      tasks.  Instead, you can use the
      <code class="literal">ModMimeUsePathInfo</code> directive in your
      Subversion <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on

  ModMimeUsePathInfo on

&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre></div><p>This directive allows <code class="literal">mod_mime</code> to attempt
      automatic deduction of the MIME type on new files that enter the
      repository via autoversioning.  The module looks at the file's
      named extension and possibly the contents as well; if the file
      matches some common patterns, the
      file's <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property will be set
      automatically.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Client Interoperability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="svn.webdav.clients"></a>Client Interoperability</h2></div></div></div><p>All WebDAV clients fall into one of three
      categoriesâstandalone applications, file-explorer

          in Java.  It's under a free Apache-like license and is
          available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/" target="_top">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/</a>.
          It does everything cadaver does, but has the
          advantages of being portable and being a more user-friendly GUI
          application.  It's also one of the first clients to support
          the new WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744).</p><p>Of course, DAV Explorer's ACL support is useless in this
          case, since <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> doesn't support
          it.  The fact that both cadaver and DAV Explorer support
          some limited DeltaV commands isn't particularly useful
          either, since they don't allow <code class="literal">MKACTIVITY</code>
          requests.  But it's not relevant anyway; we're assuming all
          of these clients are operating against an autoversioning
          repository.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="File-Explorer WebDAV Extensions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions"></a>File-Explorer WebDAV Extensions</h3></div></div></div><p>Some popular file explorer GUI programs support WebDAV
        extensions that allow a user to browse a DAV share as though it
        was just another directory on the local computer, and to
        perform basic tree editing operations on the items in that
        share.  For example, Windows Explorer is able to browse a
        WebDAV server as a <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">network place.</span>â</span>  Users can
        drag files to and from the desktop, or can rename, copy, or
        delete files in the usual way.  But because it's only a
        feature of the file explorer, the DAV share isn't visible to
        ordinary applications.  All DAV interaction must happen
        through the explorer interface.</p><div class="sect3" title="Microsoft Web Folders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions.windows"></a>Microsoft Web Folders</h4></div></div></div><p>Microsoft was one of the original backers of the WebDAV
          specification, and first started shipping a client in
          Windows 98, which was known as Web Folders.  This client was
          also shipped in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.</p><p>The original Web Folders client was an extension to
          Explorer, the main GUI program used to browse filesystems.  It
          works well enough.  In Windows 98, the feature might need to
          be explicitly installed if Web Folders aren't already visible
          inside My Computer.  In Windows 2000, simply
          add a new <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">network place,</span>â</span> enter the URL, and the
          WebDAV share will pop up for browsing.</p><p>With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft started shipping
          a new implementation of Web Folders, known as the WebDAV
          Mini-Redirector.  The new implementation is a
          filesystem-level client, allowing WebDAV shares to be mounted
          as drive letters.  Unfortunately, this implementation is
          incredibly buggy.  The client usually tries to convert HTTP
          URLs (<code class="literal">http://host/repos</code>) into UNC share
          notation (<code class="literal">\\host\repos</code>); it also often
          tries to use Windows Domain authentication to respond to
          basic-auth HTTP challenges, sending usernames as
          <code class="literal">HOST\username</code>.  These interoperability
          problems are severe and are documented in numerous places around
          the Web, to the frustration of many users.  Even Greg Stein,
          the original author of Apache's WebDAV module, bluntly
          states that XP Web Folders simply can't operate against an Apache
          server.</p><p>Windows Vista's initial implementation of Web Folders seems to
          be almost the same as XP's, so it has the same sort of
          problems.  With luck, Microsoft will remedy these issues in
          a Vista Service Pack.</p><p>However, there seem to be workarounds for both XP and
          Vista that allow Web Folders to work against Apache.  Users
          have mostly reported success with these techniques, so we'll
          relay them here.</p><p>On Windows XP, you have two options.  First, search
          Microsoft's web site for update KB907306, <span class="quote">â<span class="quote">Software
          Update for Web Folders.</span>â</span>  This may fix all your
          problems.  If it doesn't, it seems that the original pre-XP
          Web Folders implementation is still buried within the
          system.  You can unearth it by going to Network
          Places and adding a new network place.  When prompted,
          enter the URL of the repository, but <span class="emphasis"><em>include a
          port number</em></span> in the URL.  For
          example, you should enter <strong class="userinput"><code>http://host/repos</code></strong> 
          as <strong class="userinput"><code>http://host:80/repos</code></strong> instead.
          Respond to any authentication prompts with your Subversion
          credentials.</p><p>On Windows Vista, the same KB907306 update may clear
          everything up.  But there may still be other issues.  Some
          users have reported that Vista considers
          all <code class="literal">http://</code> connections insecure, and thus
          will always fail any authentication challenges from Apache
          unless the connection happens
          over <code class="literal">https://</code>.  If you're unable to connect
          to the Subversion repository via SSL, you can tweak the
          system registry to turn off this behavior.  Just change the
          value of the <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel</code>
          key from <strong class="userinput"><code>1</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>2</code></strong>.  A final warning:  be sure to set up the Web
          Folder to point to the repository's root directory
          (<code class="filename">/</code>), rather than some subdirectory
          such as <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  Vista Web Folders
          seems to work only against repository roots.</p><p>In general, while these workarounds may function for
          you, you might get a better overall experience using a
          third-party WebDAV client such as WebDrive or NetDrive.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Nautilus, Konqueror"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions.linux-de"></a>Nautilus, Konqueror</h4></div></div></div><p>Nautilus is the official file manager/browser for the
          GNOME desktop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_top">http://www.gnome.org</a>), and
          Konqueror is the manager/browser for the KDE desktop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kde.org" target="_top">http://www.kde.org</a>).  Both of these applications
          have an explorer-level WebDAV client built in, and they
          operate just fine against an autoversioning repository.</p><p>In GNOME's Nautilus, select the <span class="guimenuitem">FileâOpen
          location</span> menu item and enter the URL in the
          dialog box presented.  The repository should then be
          displayed like any other filesystem.</p><p>In KDE's Konqueror, you need to use the
          <code class="literal">webdav://</code> scheme when entering the URL in
          the location bar.  If you enter
          an <code class="literal">http://</code> URL, Konqueror will behave
          like an ordinary web browser.  You'll likely see the generic
          HTML directory listing produced
          by <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>.  When you enter
          <strong class="userinput"><code>webdav://host/repos</code></strong> instead of
          <strong class="userinput"><code>http://host/repos</code></strong>, Konqueror becomes a
          WebDAV client and displays the repository as a
          filesystem.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="WebDAV Filesystem Implementation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="svn.webdav.clients.fs-impl"></a>WebDAV Filesystem Implementation</h3></div></div></div><p>The WebDAV filesystem implementation is arguably the best
        sort of WebDAV client.  It's implemented as a low-level
        filesystem module, typically within the operating system's
        kernel.  This means that the DAV share is mounted like any
        other network filesystem, similar to mounting an NFS share on
        Unix or attaching an SMB share as a drive letter in Windows.
        As a result, this sort of client provides completely
        transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs.
        Applications aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are
        happening.</p><div class="sect3" title="WebDrive, NetDrive"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.webdav.clients.fs-impl.windows"></a>WebDrive, NetDrive</h4></div></div></div><p>Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial
          products that allow a WebDAV share to be attached as drive
          letters in Windows.  As a result, you can operate on the
          contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudodrives as easily as
          you can against real local hard drives, and in the same
          ways.  You can purchase WebDrive from South River
          Technologies (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.southrivertech.com" target="_top">http://www.southrivertech.com</a>).
          Novell's NetDrive is freely available online, but requires
          users to have a NetWare license.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Mac OS X"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="svn.webdav.clients.fs-impl.macosx"></a>Mac OS X</h4></div></div></div><p>Apple's OS X operating system has an integrated
          filesystem-level WebDAV client.  From the Finder, select the
          <span class="guimenuitem">GoâConnect to Server</span> menu
          item.  Enter a WebDAV URL, and it appears as a disk on the
          desktop, just like any other mounted volume.  You can also
          mount a WebDAV share from the Darwin terminal by using the
          <code class="literal">webdav</code> filesystem type with the
          <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span> command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="screen">
$ mount -t webdav http://svn.example.com/repos/project /some/mountpoint
$
</pre></div><p>Note that if your <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> is
          older than version 1.2, OS X will refuse to mount the share
          as read/write; it will appear as read-only.  This is because
          OS X insists on locking support for read/write shares, and
          the ability to lock files first appeared in Subversion
          1.2.</p><p>Also, OS X's WebDAV client can sometimes be overly
          sensitive to HTTP redirects.  If OS X is unable to mount the
          repository at all, you may need to enable
          the <code class="literal">BrowserMatch</code> directive in the Apache
          server's <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
            individually or via a performance rights society
            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
            performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
            of the Work.

        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
            via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry
            Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
            the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
      the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
      of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any
      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this
      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in
      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work
      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the
      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to
      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
      (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
      "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
      will not have their licenses terminated provided such
      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
      termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.

Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty
whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be
liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the
Work is licensed under the CCPL, neither party will use the trademark
"Creative Commons" or any related trademark or logo of Creative
Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any
permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons'
then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its
website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time.
